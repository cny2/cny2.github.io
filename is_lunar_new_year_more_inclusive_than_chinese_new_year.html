        <p>Simply put, Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year are not the same. Despite being related, there are a few noteworthy differences between the two. Read on to find out what they are. The Differences between Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year 1. "Chinese New Year" is specific while "Lunar New Year" is more general. 
In recent years, “Lunar New Year” has gained traction as more inclusive than “Chinese New Year.” This shift is partly driven by efforts from countries such as South Korea and Vietnam. Both nations have long-celebrated lunar new year traditions, but have increasingly pushed for the use of “Lunar New Year” to distance themselves from  
Elicit or explain that this article explores how members of the Vietnamese community in Canada felt excluded by the way Lunar New Year was discussed and depicted in images in 2023. Why is this important? Despite the use of the more inclusive term, “Lunar New Year,” we see that promoting inclusion goes beyond the naming of a holiday. 
The push for ‘Lunar New Year’ Lunar New Year marks the beginning of the lunisolar calendar, with festivities often lasting for 15 days or more. 
Saying ‘Lunar New Year’ may be more inclusive to other parts of Asia that celebrate the occasion, but is unnecessary when the context and the people addressed are clearly Chinese. 
Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year are rich in cultural meaning and tradition. But it’s not the same. Lunar New Year encompasses celebrations of many cultures, while Chinese New Year focuses on specific Chinese traditions. When learning about these differences we can appreciate the diversity and beauty of each celebration. 
Among China’s traditional holidays and celebrations, none ranks higher in importance than the Lunar New Year (農曆新年). Also known as the Spring Festival (春節), or simply Chinese New  
Are you already planning activities for 'Chinese New Year'? Firstly, It's important to use the more inclusive term 'Lunar New Year', as this Spring celebration is not only for people of Chinese descent, but also for Koreans, Vietnamese, Mongolians, and people from East and Southeast Asia. Let’s continue to reflect, ponder and challenge practice. 
Lunar New Year is a festival beyond compare. Technically it’s a week—determined by the lunar calendar but always late January to mid-February—but for many, Chunjie (Spring Festival) is more  
In diaspora communities, particularly in cultural enclaves, Lunar New Year is visibly and joyfully celebrated. In the Chinese zodiac, 2025 is the Year of the Snake. Different countries across Asia celebrate the new year in many ways and may follow a different zodiac. What is the Lunar New Year? 
Lunar New Year is celebrated in many Asian and Asian diasporic cultures including Vietnamese (Tết Nguyên Đán), Korean (Seollal), Chinese (The Spring Festival or Chinese New Year), Taiwanese, Malay and many others, and is one of the most important holidays in the year. 
In the spirit of inclusive language, we generally refer to the time of the year as ‘Lunar New Year’. However, it’s also important to note that saying ‘Chinese New Year’ isn’t incorrect, but is more a matter of context. When does this event take place? Lunar New Year marks the start of the new year of the lunisolar calendar, which is  
Happy tet. Happy Chunjie. Happy seollal etc. If u and the recipient are of different culture, its best to say both. Happy korean new year and chinese new year! “Happy lunar new year” should be ok too, but now its associated with intention of not wanting to say “happy chinese new year” so some chinese people might not like hearing it. 
Both are fine. Hell, we celebrate lunar new year in my household because of mu Vietnamese wife, but even she has always called it Chinese New Year. That being said, there are other countries that celebrate, so "lunar New year" is more inclusive, and more accurate since the holiday is based off the lunar calendar, not the solar one. 
Lunar new year: it’s more inclusive since many Asian countries celebrate it with different traditions, and the lunar cycle is associated with the holiday whether or not they follow the lunar calendar or lunar solar. 
Let’s Explore: Lunar New Year Program . Panda Express is proud to continue its "Let’s Explore!: Lunar New Year" program, first launched in 2008 to . help educators bring the traditions and stories of Lunar New Year into classrooms. Through partnerships with 
The problem with calling Chinese New Year lunar new year is that the Chinese calendar is a lunisolar calendar not a lunar calendar. the Islamic calendar is the only major calendar that is actually a lunar calendar. furthermore, most calendars in the world are lunisolar/lunar; such as the Jewish, Indian, Persia, etc. 
If one HAS to make some sort of distinction, then I think "Chinese" for the new year that falls between January 21 and February 20 makes more sense than "Lunar" because it's the specific lunar calendar that's based on the Chinese lunar calendar (the Vietnamese and Korean lunar calendar are basically based on the chinese one, the difference is  
If you look up the Wikipedia page for Lunar New Year and compare it to the page for Chinese New Year, the page for Chinese New Year is at least five times longer, despite being the less general event. But generalizing Lunar New Year as Chinese New Year is more than just saying the wrong word and using the wrong name.
