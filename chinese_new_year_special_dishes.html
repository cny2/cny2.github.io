        <p>In Chinese, "fish" (鱼 Yú /yoo/) sounds like 'surplus'. Fish is a traditional Chinese New Year dish on the Chinese New Year dinner menu. Chinese people always like to have a surplus at the end of the year, because they think if they have managed to save something at the end of the year, then they can make more in the next year. 
“Ji” sounds like “lucky” in Chinese, making this dish a symbol of good fortune. A whole chicken signifies family unity and completeness, promising a harmonious year together. Whole Steamed Chicken, a centrepiece in Lunar New Year celebrations, goes beyond culinary delight to embody profound symbols of good fortune and family unity.

You may think “Lunar New Year” and “Chinese New Year” refer to the same event. That’s not the case!

In 2025, China begins to celebrate its Lunar New Year on  
Nian Gao. Many lucky Chinese New Year foods involve wordplay and puns. In the case of Nian Gao, the name alludes to things increasing/getting higher in the year, so think higher salary, higher income, higher height (for kids) and positive increases all around.
