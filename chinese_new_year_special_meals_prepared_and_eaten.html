        <h2><strong>chinese new year special meals prepared and eaten chinese symbols for chinese new year</strong></h2>
        <p>The auspicious symbolism of these traditional Chinese New Year foods is based on their pronunciations or appearance. Not only do the dishes themselves matter, but also the preparation, and ways of serving and eating mean a lot. The most common Chinese New Year foods include dumplings, fish, spring rolls, and niangao. We've rounded up 12  
Most Americans consider January 1 the start of the new year, but many Asians and Asian-Americans don’t. Instead, they follow Lunar New Year, also referred to as Chinese New Year in the U.S., which begins on January 29, 2025. (That’s the Year of the Snake in the Chinese zodiac, BTW.) 
The act of sharing and enjoying these delectable pockets during the New Year celebrations becomes a communal tradition that extends beyond culinary delight, fostering a sense of togetherness and the belief in the prosperous journey that lies ahead. 20. Niangao (Chinese New Year Cake) 
Nian gao, also known as “rice cake” or “New Year cake” in English, are a must for Chinese New Year. In ancient times, nian gao were used only as offerings to the ancestors and gods. Gradually, they became a traditional dish during the Spring Festival. Now they are available every day of the year, but are still a special treat for the  
The Chinese New Year, also known as Lunar New Year, is the most important festival in China: it lasts up to two weeks and is the only time of the year when China shuts down. Unlike Western countries, the Chinese New Year generally falls between January 21st and February 20th in the Gregorian calendar, according to the Chinese lunar calendar. 
Step 1: Add water into the flour to make a dough. Knead the dough and then cover it for later use. Step 2: Prepare the fillings by mixing the ground pork with chopped celery, ginger and green onion and add other seasonings. 
Chinese New Year is all about gathering with family and friends to welcome the new year, which falls on January 29 this year! For 15 days, we will gather with our loved ones and share delicious meals. Chinese New Year food is literally a feast of sorts, like turnip cakes and CNY puddings; and these foods are eaten for auspicious reasons. 
The Year of the Snake 🐍 (蛇年) is fast approaching! In 2025, the Chinese Lunar New Year falls on Wednesday, January 29, and the celebration lasts at least 15 days. To help you prepare for celebratory meals, I’ve curated 30 popular recipes for this most important occasion. 
Chinese Curry Chicken is a traditional Chinese New Year dish that will dance in your mouth! Made with tender chicken thighs, aromatic red curry paste , turmeric powder, tangy lemongrass, and a bit of heat from dried chili peppers, it's a one-pot meal that's a cinch to prepare! 
But in China, especially in the South, pork tongue is a staple for special occasions like Chinese New Year. “猪脷,” pork tongue in Chinese, sounds similar to “吉利,” good luck. That’s why it’s one of the most popular main courses for Chinese New Year. 
The Chinese New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, is a time of joy, family reunions, and, of course, indulging in delicious food. Each dish served during this festive period carries a special meaning, symbolizing prosperity, luck, and togetherness.

With a history of more than 1,800 years, dumplings are the most well-known Chinese dish in China and other countries in the world. According to ancient legend, the more dumplings you eat during the New Year celebrations, the more money you can make in the upcoming Year.

Green is a color associated with wealth and currency, so leafy greens like lettuce, spinach and bok choy are often served as a Chinese New Year food. During Chinese New Year, these foods are often included in stir fry, soups, spring rolls and salads. The hope is some of that promised prosperity will manifest in your new year. 6. Dumplings 
One of the most traditional southern Chinese New Year dish that is eaten during the festive period is the lo hei salad. It originates from Guangdong province but was popularised in Singapore and Malaysia in the 1960s, where it remains a Chinese New Year staple among ethnic Chinese today. 
Another food you definitely want to put on your Chinese New Year food list for this Year of the Tiger is tang yuan — black sesame filled sweet rice balls that are typically served in a sweet soup. These little balls of joy symbolize a happy family reunion because their name sounds like a Chinese phrase for ‘reunion’ and ‘togetherness’.
