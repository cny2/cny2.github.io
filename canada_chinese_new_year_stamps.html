        <p>The Lunar New Year cycle showcased all of the animals in the Chinese zodiac: Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Ram, Monkey, Rooster, Dog and Pig. Conceived well before the series was launched, this collection features 24 stamps based on the designs of all the previous domestic and international rate stamps in the last 12 years. 
About the Stamps. Designed by Paprika, this collectible, wrap-up issue features all 24 of the original stamp designs – one Permanent ™ domestic rate stamp and one international stamp rate from each year – from the 2009 to 2020 Lunar New Year series. Sharing standardized elements, such as size, palette, perforations and special effects

The Lunar New Year consists of 12 periods named after animals (listed to the left). Canada began issuing stamps for the Chinese Lunar New Year in 1997. Starting in 1999, two different values were issued: one for the domestic first class postal rate and another in the international rate (the latter was also issued in a souvenir sheet). 
Another pair of Year of the Rat stamps (Scott #2257-28) were issued in 2008 to close out Canada Post’s previous Lunar New Year series. Designed by Toronto-based artist Harvey Chan, they feature two stylized rats based on another Chinese folk tale, “The Mouse Bride.” 
The new stamps reuse the 24 designs from this series, which started in 2009 with Year of the Ox stamps (Scott 2296-2297) and continued through 2020 with Year of the Rat stamps (3229-3232). The stamps in the new pane of 12 are moisture-activated. They show the designs of the 12 permanent-rate stamps in the series, and like those stamps each new  
Swirls, a graphic element from ancient Chinese designs, are placed at the bottom of the domestic-rate stamp to represent the water element. The Chinese characters in the top right corner spell out “dragon.” “It’s always a challenge to find novel ways to showcase the Lunar New Year stamps,” says Alain Leduc, Canada Post Stamp Design  
These stamps are the fourth release in a twelve-year Lunar New Year series. “Lunar New Year is celebrated around the world, in countries and territories with significant Chinese communities. Canada Post is proud to celebrate the occasion by issuing these popular stamps,” said Jim Phillips, Director of Stamp Services at Canada Post. 
After one final bark from the Year of the Dog, the Year of the Pig will trot into the limelight on Feb. 5 before squealing to a stop on Jan. 24, 2020. As part of the 11th issue in Canada Post’s second 12-year Lunar New Year series, two stamps celebrate this porcine sign, which also ruled the Chinese zodiac in 2007, 1995, 1983, 1971 and 1959  
Special collectible issue features all 24 stamp designs from the last 12 years. OTTAWA – As spectacular as the celebration itself, a special set of Lunar New Year stamps was issued today, ushering in the Year of the Ox with a retrospective collection of all 24 colourful stamp designs from the past 12 years. 
The new stamps mark the end of our second Lunar New Year series, which contained some of the most popular stamps we’ve ever produced. The first series ran from 1997 to 2008. “It’s a perennial favourite with collectors and consumers alike,” says Jim Phillips, Canada Post’s Director of Stamp Services. 
Since then, Canada Post has been issuing a stamp for the Chinese New Year each year. 2009-2021 From 2009 to 2020, Canada Post issued an exquisite Chinese New Year stamp that was part of one of Canada Post’s most popular and longest-running series, which featured such elaborate techniques as gold and silver foiling and multi-level embossing.
