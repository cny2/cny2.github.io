        <h2><strong>chinese new year holidays vietnam chinese new year rooster quotes</strong></h2>
        <p>The traditional New Year’s Day of Vietnam and much of Asia comes on the first day of the first month of the ancient lunisolar calendar. This typically puts “Tet” in late January or early February on the Gregorian Calendar. The holiday is celebrated for several consecutive days. 
Lunar New Year or Tết Nguyên Đán, is Vietnam’s most significant celebration. Across Vietnam, during this time families reunite and honour their ancestors, while praying for luck, prosperity and health in the new year. The public holiday may only run for one week, but in reality, Tết celebrations last much longer. 
While similar to the Chinese Lunar New Year, Tết has distinct traditions and cultural significance unique to Vietnam. The holiday’s origins date back to the 18th century B.C., influenced by Chinese culture, though it has evolved over centuries to reflect Vietnam’s unique customs. 
The Lunar Year holiday was originally brought to Vietnam by the Chinese, who had formally incorporated Vietnam into their Han Dynasty empire in 111 BCE and mostly had ruled it for over 1000 years until the collapse of the Tang Dynasty in the 10th century. That historic period of Chinese rule had significantly influenced Vietnamese culture

Yet, there may be differences due to time zone offsets. For example, the Chinese Lunar New Year will be 1 hour or 1 day later than the Vietnamese Lunar New Year.

The Vietnamese Lunar New Year Tet (Tết) is one of the most important traditional holidays in Vietnamese culture. Similar to the Chinese New Year, Vietnam celebrates the new year according to the lunar calendar.

In some other Asian countries such as Thailand or Laos, the festival is celebrated around late October or early November to mark the end of the Buddhist Lent &amp; the beginning of the festive season.

Tet Nguyen Dan, shortened to Tet, is Vietnam's Lunar New Year and is the most important annual celebration and public holiday in Vietnam spanning 5-7 days. Tet celebrates the beginning of a new year as well the coming of spring. Exuberant festivities are held — traditional  
The Vietnamese New Year was first celebrated by the Chinese in Vietnam over 2000 years ago. At that time, Vietnam was part of Ancient China and so the Chinese New Year transcended generations to become the Vietnamese New Year. The Tet festival was originally a three-day celebration, but it has gradually expanded to last up to two weeks. 
Tết Nguyên Đán or the Vietnamese Lunar New Year celebrates the arrival of spring and marks the beginning of a new year according to the Vietnamese lunar calendar. During Tết, Vietnamese families honor their ancestors, exchange gifts, and enjoy special foods as they look forward to a year of prosperity and good fortune.
