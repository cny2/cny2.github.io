Aloha Marvellina, I am trying your recipe in preparation for Chinese New Year. Thanks to a comment from another, I went ahead and used the half recipe with two small 4 inch round glass ramekins with banana leaves in a dutch oven. Instead of foil, I used some extra banana leaves to cover the tops. It came out perfect in about 1.5 hours. 
The lunar new year is around the corner. Like last year we will be making some special snacks to welcome the new year. Today, we will learn how to make Chinese new years cake, also known as nian gao 年糕. Nian gao is made with glutinous rice flour which gives the nian gao a sticky and chewy texture. 
Rosettes are a thin, cookie-like deep-fried pastries of Scandinavian and Indian origin. The Malaysian Rosette (Kuih Rose) was probably a Dutch influence. A Treat with Many Names. How then did Kuih Rose become Kuih Loyang? Well, loyang is brass in Malay and the mold is made of brass. So, it is actually Brass Cake if translated literally. 
Kuih Bahulu (Malaysian Egg Cake) is a traditional Malaysian treat that’s loved by people of all ages and backgrounds. These sweet, eggy cakes are especially popular during festive seasons like Hari Raya and Chinese New Year. They’re the perfect bite-sized snack to pair with a cup of coffee, making them a hit at any gathering.

Chinese New Year is such a special celebration, and the excitement kicks off with Dongzhi (冬至) or Winter Solstice, about a month before the actual New Year.. As the final lunar month approaches, families get busy baking, cleaning, and shopping in preparation. 
Chinese New Year is one week away and for the past week, I have been busy making all the Chinese New Year cookies, munchies and snacks for the celebration.. Other than that, I have been crazy shopping for new clothes for little G (it’s a tradition that we wear new attire on the first day of Chinese New Year!), plus crazy spring cleaning the entire house. 
Nian Gao or Chinese New year Cake has always been and still is a favourite among Chinese during the Chinese New Year. Every family will buy or make these sweet nian gao to celebrate the new year as this auspicious sticky rice cake symbolises prosperity and good luck for the year ahead. So what do we do with the extra leftover of the nian gao  
Kuih Bahulu (Malaysian Egg Cake) If you’re a fan of Chinese restaurants, you may have had Malaysian egg cake at some point. However, as is true with most things, the ones you make at home taste so much better. You’ll only need the most basic ingredients – eggs, flour, butter, baking soda, sugar, and vanilla extract. 
Pan Fried Nian Gao – A Delicious Recipe To Enjoy Chinese New Year Cake (Kuih Bakul) Pan Fried Nian Gao is an extremely yummy dessert, perfect for Chinese New Year.Soft and chewy Nian Gao (sticky rice cake) is first slice into pieces, then coat with a slightly thick egg batter and pan fried to golden brown perfection.

Like Malaysian kueh, this Chinese steamed water chestnut cake is unlike the Western sponge cakes we know and love. Instead it's more of a jelly-like/pudding-like dessert. Soft and crunchy from the bits of water chestnut, it's subtly sweet and delicately nutty, with a hint of caramel from brown or yellow rock sugar. </p>
