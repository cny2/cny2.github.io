        <p>The Chingay Parade traces its origins to a float decorating competition held in Penang in 1905. This practice of float decoration spread to the rest of Malaya by the 1960s, and eventually became associated with the Chinese New Year. The second Chingay procession was held in 1926 in celebration of the birthday of the God of Prosperity. 
The first formal Chingay Parade in Singapore was mooted by our founding Prime Minister, the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew, who was also the former Chairman of the People’s Association (PA).

However, in Johor Bahru, the town is still bustling with excitement even after the 15th day of the first lunar month, and the atmosphere is even more enthusiastic, because for the people in Johor Bahru, the New Year is not officially over until after the 20th day of the first month. 
The Chingay Parade in Singapore usually takes place during the second weekend of the Chinese New Year. This year, the Chinese New Year started on February 10th, so the Chingay Parade would have normally been held around February 23th-24th starting from 8.00 PM to 9:30 PM.

Chingay is an annual street parade held as part of the Chinese New Year celebrations. The word “Chingay” is derived from the Chinese term zhuangyi, meaning "the art of costume and masquerade". 
Nevertheless, Chingay was also held during important Chinese festivals like Chinese New Year. As the Chinese in Malaysia prospered, the parades became grander. Traditionally the Chingay flag bearers would balance the 30-foot high flag, weighing near to 30 kilograms on their foreheads, chins, hands, feet and any part of the body.
