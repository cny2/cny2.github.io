        <h2><strong>meaning behind chinese new year instrumental music for chinese new year</strong></h2>
        <p>Since the mid-1990s people in China have been given seven consecutive days off work during the Chinese New Year. This week of relaxation has been designated Spring Festival, a term that is sometimes used to refer to the Chinese New Year in general. The origins of the Chinese New Year are steeped in legend. One legend is that thousands of years  
Layue (simplified Chinese: 腊月; traditional Chinese: 臘月; pinyin: Làyuè) is a term often associated with Chinese New Year as it refers to the sacrifices held in honour of the gods in the twelfth lunisolar month, hence the cured meats of Chinese New Year are known as larou (simplified Chinese: 腊肉; traditional Chinese: 臘肉; pinyin  
The origin of the Chinese New Year Festival can be traced back to about 3,500 years ago. Chinese New Year has evolved over a long period of time and its customs have undergone a long development process. A Legend of the Origin of Chinese New Year. Like all traditional festivals in China, Chinese New Year is steeped with stories and myths. 
Legend of the Origin of Chinese New Year. Chinese New Year is steeped with stories and myths. One of the most popular legends is about the mythical beast Nian (Year). He ate livestock, crops, and even people on the eve of a new year. To prevent Nian from attacking people and causing destruction, people put food at their doors for Nian. 
Chinese New Year, also referred to as the Lunar New Year or the Spring Festival, is one of the most important traditional Chinese festivals and began around 3,500 years ago. This festivity is tied to the Chinese lunar calendar, and it originated as a time for feasting and to honor household and heavenly deities and ancestors. 
The date of Chinese New Year changes each year because it's based on the lunar calendar. While the western Gregorian calendar is based on the Earth’s orbit around the sun, the date of Chinese New Year is determined according to the moon’s orbit around the Earth. Chinese New Year falls on the second new moon after the winter solstice. 
Chinese New Year (Spring Festival) is the oldest traditional festival in China, but a few people concern the origin and story behind the holiday. Many existing customs and activities of the festival actually can be traced back to a popular story of the Monster Nian, which helps to explain why and how the festival is celebrated. 
Chinese New Year is also a time to ward off evil spirits and bad luck. Many traditions and customs, such as setting off fireworks and hanging red decorations, are believed to bring good luck and prosperity while scaring away any negative energies. Another important aspect of Chinese New Year is the emphasis on family and togetherness. Families  
The history of Chinese New Year can be dated back to 3,800 years ago. Its origin was the worshiping activities for harvest in Shang Dynasty (17th century -1046 BC). 
No Chinese New Year would be complete without its traditional fare. Delicacies such as nian gao, a sweet sticky rice cake, and savory dumplings are enjoyed, each with its own symbolic meaning, promising luck, wealth, and prosperity for the year ahead. From Dynasty to Dynasty: The Evolution of Celebration 
Unsurprising of a story so old, alternative origins exist, including one version of the legend that includes sealing money in red paper. But the earliest examples of mass-produced envelopes today synonymous with Chinese New Year appear to be from 1961, produced by Wells Fargo.
