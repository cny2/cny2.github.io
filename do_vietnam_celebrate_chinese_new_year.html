        <p>The Vietnamese New Year celebration of Tet, short for Tet Nguyen Dan which means “festival of the first day”, is celebrated over three days as opposed to the traditional 15 of the Chinese New  
Different countries across Asia celebrate the new year in many ways and may follow a different zodiac. What is the Lunar New Year? The Lunar New Year — known as the Spring Festival in China, Tet in Vietnam and Seollal in Korea — is a major festival 
In the Chinese zodiac, each new year, according to the lunar calendar, is associated with one of 12 animals, and 2025 marks the Year of the Snake.  In Vietnam, the holiday is known as Tet, and  
No Tết celebration is complete without a mention of the Vietnamese zodiac. Like its Chinese counterpart, the Vietnamese zodiac is a 12-year cycle where each year is associated with an animal. However, Vietnam adds its own unique twist to this tradition. The Rabbit is replaced by the Cat, believed to bring a sense of calmness and prosperity. 
After living in China for 3 years as V-Trust Sales Manager and 1 year in Vietnam as V-Trust Country Manager, I am happy to share my experience and feelings, even if, for sure, I don’t know everything and they may not be exhaustive. Chinese New Year and the Vietnamese New Year (called Tết in Vietnam) actually have a lot in common. 
4. Vietnamese New Year Is Different from Chinese New Year. 5. Vietnamese New Year Is Celebrated Either in January or February. 6. Tet Celebrations Last Much Longer than the 7-Day Public Holiday. 7. Honoring Ong Tao Marks the Beginning of Vietnamese Lunar New Year. 8. Preparation for Lunar New Year Begins Weeks in Advance. 9. 
The Vietnamese New Year was first celebrated by the Chinese in Vietnam over 2000 years ago. At that time, Vietnam was part of Ancient China and so the Chinese New Year transcended generations to become the Vietnamese New Year. The Tet festival was originally a three-day celebration, but it has gradually expanded to last up to two weeks. 
Rarely, the dates of Vietnamese and Chinese Lunar New Year can differ, such as in 1943, when Vietnam celebrated Lunar New Year one month after China. It takes place from the first day of the first month of the Vietnamese lunar calendar (around late January or early February) until at least the third day. 
Yet, there may be differences due to time zone offsets. For example, the Chinese Lunar New Year will be 1 hour or 1 day later than the Vietnamese Lunar New Year. Interestingly, the Vietnamese usually start Tet preparations two weeks or even a month before, creating a buzzing atmosphere at the spring entrance. 
Tet celebrations can range from 3 days and continue for up to one week. The festival is split into the day before New Year's Eve, New Year's Eve, and New Year's Day. All of these days correspond to the Vietnamese or lunar calendar, so they will happen on a different date every year. Tet Festival falls on January 29th in 2025. 
Tết Nguyên Đán or the Vietnamese Lunar New Year celebrates the arrival of spring and marks the beginning of a new year according to the Vietnamese lunar calendar. During Tết, Vietnamese families honor their ancestors, exchange gifts, and enjoy special foods as they look forward to a year of prosperity and good fortune. 
Lunar New Year is called Tết in Vietnam.Adults give small red envelopes filled with cash, called lì xì, to children.Certain special foods such as banh chung (savory rice cakes) are served, and  
Lunar New Year or Tết Nguyên Đán, is Vietnam’s most significant celebration. Across Vietnam, during this time families reunite and honour their ancestors, while praying for luck, prosperity and health in the new year. The public holiday may only run for one week, but in reality, Tết celebrations last much longer. 
Vietnamese New Year or Vietnamese Lunar New Year is called Tết or Tết Nguyên Đán or also Tết Âm Lịch in Vietnamese. It’s the most important event of the year in Vietnam. If you are new to Tết, you can have a look at my previous article to better understand what is Tet and why it’s so important to Vietnamese people. 
In a word, no. Tet is lunar new year, or you might know it as Chinese New Year. It occurs on a different day every year, since it marks the night of the first new moon of the year, sometime between January 21st and February 20th. If you’re planning a trip to Vietnam during Tet, read on to find out why this is not a good idea. 
Vietnam: Known as Tết in Vietnam, the Lunar New Year celebrations share similarities with Chinese New Year, including family gatherings, lucky money envelopes, and lion dances.
