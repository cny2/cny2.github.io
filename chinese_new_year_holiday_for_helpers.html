        <p>If a statutory holiday falls on a domestic helper’s rest day, the helper must be given that day and the following day off.

Can I Ask the Domestic Helper to Work on Statutory Holidays? Employers must give the domestic helper a total of 14 statutory holidays in a year. If you cannot let the helper take leave on a holiday, you should give prior notice of not less than 48 hours and an alternative holiday within 60 days.
