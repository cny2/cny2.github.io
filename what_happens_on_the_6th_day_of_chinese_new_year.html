        <h2><strong>what happens on the 6th day of chinese new year when is chinese new year 2025 start and end holiday</strong></h2>
        <p>According to Chinese genesis, the goddess Nu-Wa with snake body (2852-2738 B.C.) created chicken on the first day of the first lunar month, dog on the 2nd lunar day, pig on the 3rd lunar day, sheep on the 4th lunar day, ox on the 5th lunar day, and horse on the 6th lunar day. 
The rubbish from the first to the fourth day of the Chinese New Year is considered “wealth”, but after the fifth day, the garbage will turn into a sign of “poverty”. 
Chinese New Year, the grandest festival for Chinese people, is celebrated for more than half a month.According to the oldest traditions, people follow a day-by-day schedule of Chinese New Year festivities from the 23rd day of the 12th lunar month, with specific things to do on certain days. 
Chinese New Year's Eve (Jan. 28, 2025): 6 Traditions and Activities - 除夕. As the last day of the lunar year, Chinese New Year's Eve (除夕 chú xī) is the day before Chinese New Year. It is a grand reunion time for the whole Chinese family. 
The sixth day of Chinese New Year is the time to send the Poor Devil away in folklore. The Poor Devil is said to be a short and thin man who likes dressing in rags, and eating rice-porridge. Even given new clothes, he would only wear them after tearing the clothes, or burning holes in them. 
People eat dumplings and many New Year taboos can be broken on this day, as it is also called the Festival of Po Wu—literally, breaking five. On the sixth day of Zheng Yue, send away the Ghost of Poverty by discarding ragged clothes, rubbish, and other dirty items. 
You may have heard of the Chinese New Year being referred to as Lunar New Year. “Lunar” means the start of a new year as marked by the lunar calendar. The Chinese used the lunar calendar for thousands of years until they adopted the Gregorian calendar in the 20th century. Did you know: the Chinese zodiac is based on the lunar calendar.

Chinese New Year in 2025 falls on January 29 and ends with the Lantern Festival on Feb. 12. Celebrations last up to 16 days; the Chinese public holiday lasts from Wednesday to Feb. 4. What is the  
Chinese New Year is the festival that celebrates the beginning of a new year on the traditional Chinese lunisolar calendar. Chinese New Year 2025 will fall on Wednesday, January 29th. The date changes every year but is always somewhere in the period from January 21st to February 20th. 
Fourth Day of Chinese New Year 初四. The day to honour the Kitchen god who would return to Heaven to report on the family to the Jade Emperor, some place nian2 gao1 (New Year Sticky Cake) as offerings to appease the Kitchen god who then either can’t speak much due to the stickiness of the sweet cake or speaks sweet nothings about the family. 
In many Chinese cities, the local temple serves as a spiritual center. The third day of the new year, January 31, 2025, is traditionally a day for visiting temples. People visit to make offerings, seek blessings from deities, and consult fortune-tellers about the year ahead. This is also a time to pause and reflect spiritually as the new year  
2025 Chinese New Year (the first day of first lunar month) falls on Jan.29, 2024 and the year lasts to Feb.16, 2027. In folk custom, the New Year celebrating starts from the Laba Festival (the 12th day of the 12th lunar month) or Little Year (the 23rd day of the 12th lunar month) to the Lantern Festival (the 15th day of the first lunar month). 
The Chinese believe that New Year’s Day sets the tone for the rest of the year, so it’s generally a quiet affair filled with positive thoughts among adults and good behavior among children. Just as you would call your parents on the Western New Year’s Day, it’s traditional to visit (or call or Skype) your parents and grandparents. 
The legal holiday is seven days long, from the Lunar New Year's Eve to the sixth day of the first lunar month. Some companies and public institutions enjoy a longer holiday up to 10 days or more, because in common knowledge among Chinese people, the festival lasts longer, from the Lunar New Year's Eve to the 15th day of the first lunar month (Lantern Festival). 
The first day of the New Year is known as Yuan Dan (Chinese: 元旦; pinyin: yuándàn (First Morning of the year), New Year’s Day, First Day (or Duan Ri). During the 15 day period new year visits (Traditional Chinese: 拜年; pinyin: bài nián, translated: pay respect, worship, salute the year) will be made to family and friends. 
Each Chinese lunar year has a Chinese zodiac sign animal. The Chinese zodiac year's stsarting date is a little different from the Gregorian year. It starts from Chinese New Year. The Chinese zodiac years chart below is provided to help you find out the exact starting and ending dates of the Chinese zodiac years. (This is especially useful for  
If this day has a good weather, then it symbolize that it will be a fruitful harvest this year. 9: Day 9 of lunar new year is the birthday of the Jade Emperor according to folks' custom, so large scale celebration is being held to thank the gods. On this day, people will pray to "天公" for the new year to be more prosperous and good fortune. 10
