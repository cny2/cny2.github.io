        <p>Why does Chinese New Year fall on different dates? Rather than following the western Gregorian Calendar with 365-day years, the Chinese New Year follows a lunar calendar based the moon's 12 phases  
On Jan. 29, Asian American communities around the U.S. will ring in the Year of the Snake with community carnivals, family gatherings, parades, traditional food, fireworks and other festivities. In 
Lunar New Year is a festival beyond compare. Technically it’s a week—determined by the lunar calendar but always late January to mid-February—but for many, Chunjie (Spring Festival) is more  
You probably already know about Chinese New Year. Chinese New Year is a lunar new year celebration that’s similar to lunar calendars used by Tibetans, Hindus, certain Buddhist groups, and even one sect of Judaism. Lunar New Year is celebrated when the first new lunar cycle starts with a new moon. (A new moon is the absence of the moon.) 
January 25, 2020; February 12, 2021; February 1, 2022; Chinese Language Tip. During Chinese New Year, you can greet your Chinese speaking friends by saying any of the following greetings. 
If you are a cultural buff, it’s worthwhile to have a tour during Chinese Lunar New Year. See our sample tours for some inspiration.

In contexts outside of China, referring to Lunar New Year as "Chinese New Year" and vice versa can come off as insensitive and offensive because it ignores other cultures, all of which have their own unique traditions, beliefs, and celebrations. 2. How each Asian country celebrates and names their New Year festival is different. 
A longstanding debate over the usage of “Chinese New Year” versus “Lunar New Year” has reignited in recent weeks as people around the world celebrated the holiday, with brands and  
Lunar New Year celebrations can last up to 15 days, starting on the new moon between late January and mid-February. The exact date varies each year based on the lunar calendar. The new year begins  
Unlike the American New Year, the Chinese New Year is celebrated continually for 15 days after New Year’s Day, when the first full moon of the year occurs. In preparation for such an extensive celebration, all houses are cleaned to sweep away bad spirits and decorated to reflect the commemoration of the new year. 
This is a great New Year activity or Chinese New Year Activity and makes a great addition to a holiday unit. It also is a great activity to simply practice comparing and contrasting. Included in this resource: 1 page nonfiction reading passage about American New Year with comprehension questions 
The Chinese new year is from the American perspective, because The Chinese came to USA earlier that other Asian Group. My personal view is that you can say Chinese New Year to the other person as long as they are Chinese. Or you are a Chinese you want to wish western people a happy Chinese new year. 
CHINESE NEW YEAR . Unlike the American New Year celebration, the Chinese New Year will be celebrated on February 16, 2018 and marks the beginning of a new lunar according to the traditional Chinese calendar rather than the Gregorian calendar. The yearly Chinese holiday is known as the Lunar New Year or the Spring Festival. 
American Traditions Chinese Traditions During New Years there is a Dragon dance where men and women dressed up as a dragon and dance around. It is meant to bless the new year. There would also be traditional music played while the dragons danced. 
Conclusion. Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year are rich in cultural meaning and tradition. But it’s not the same. Lunar New Year encompasses celebrations of many cultures, while Chinese New Year focuses on specific Chinese traditions. 
Lunar New Year vs Chinese New Year. While many use the terms Lunar New Year and Chinese New Year interchangeably, Lunar New Year encompasses celebrations across cultures, such as Korean Seollal, Vietnamese Tết, and more. Acknowledging these differences highlights the rich diversity of this shared tradition. 
Korean New Year is NOT the same as Chinese New Year. But it is similar. And everyone has a tendency to refer to the Lunar New Year as Chinese New Year. Although, it’s no wonder because China has the world’s largest population! Not to mention that the traditions of Chinese New Year are just fun with dragon dances, fireworks, and the like! 
China wanted to do everything Western, so it celebrated the January 1 New Year. In fact, in 1949, the Communist Party forbade the celebration of the traditional Chinese New Year. However, by the 1980s, new Chinese leaders had a change of heart and allowed the celebration of the traditional Chinese New Year. 
The actual real lunar new year is based on the Islamic calendar. Chinese people don’t even call it “Chinese New Year”. They call it 春節 or Spring Festival or 農曆新年 or Agricultural New Year. Both these names, Agricultural New Year and Spring Festival are more accurate names than Lunar New Year.
