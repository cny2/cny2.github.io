        <p>In the same group, the three animals could live harmoniously, understand and bring good luck to each other. So, the three are best matches. For example if you are born in the year of the Rat, your 三合 (San He) is Dragon and Monkey. 3 of you will form the 三合 (San He). 1. Rat, Dragon, Monkey 2. Ox, Snake, Rooster 3. Tiger, Horse, Dog 4. 
There are twelve zodiacal animal signs in Chinese calendar and people born under each animal sign have different characteristics and personalities. It is possible to check details and compatibilities to gain guidance in life, for love or marriage. In fact, the zodiac compatibility can offer guidance for any relationship. 
Like astrology matching, Chinese people use Chinese zodiac compatibility for marriage or romantic relationships. The Chinese zodiac is a cycle of 12 animal signs. Your birth year sign's attributes are believed to determine compatibility with other signs. 
Compatibility Beyond Chinese Zodiac Signs. Zodiac signs are just one facet of compatibility in Chinese zodiacs, which can almost be considered an entire discipline. This is because, aside from calculating compatibility based on zodiac animals, you must also think about other factors, including the Five Elements Theory. As shown on the chart  
This Love Match method gives people much better advice than the Chinese Birth Year Zodiac Sign Match and Western Zodiac Sign Match, according to thousands of feedbacks for the past 20 years. The Fast Love Match calculates a love compatibility score for each love match. 
Chinese zodiac compatibility list for the 12 animals signs Rat compatibility. Rat birth years: 1924, 1936, 1948, 1960, 1972, 1984, 1996, 2008, 2020 
Chinese Zodiac Love Compatibility for 12 Signs. The concept of the 12 Chinese zodiac signs, each represented by an animal, is rooted in the Jade Emperor’s legendary race. 
This is because the Chinese Zodiac follows the Lunar Year, which begins at a different date every year as it’s meant to land on the first new moon of the lunar calendar. The Lunar New Year usually falls between January 21-February 20, or on the second new moon following the winter solstice on December 21st. 
You probably know that the Chinese zodiac is a 12-year continuous cycle based on the lunar calendar. This cycle renews at the Lunar New Year or Spring Festival every late January or early February, marking the transition from one animal sign to the next. The origins of the Chinese zodiac date back 2,000 years to the Qin Dynasty. 
The next section reveals possible good matches for your sign. A good match might not be the ideal or perfect match, but it also has a good track record for a long-lasting and happy marriage. The couple might not be as yin and yang as the ideal matches but are still a good balance of chi energy. 
LIKE the Western horoscope there are 12 signs in the Chinese zodiac, but instead of changing once a month they change once a year. Find your Chinese sign from the tables, then discover which of the 144 love matches will really bring out your animal passions and why The Ox is just what we need.

Chinese New Year Zodiac love compatibility – Best matches and date partners. Mystic Meg; Published: 21:40, 11 Feb 2021; Updated: 10:13, 10 Jan 2023; 
According to Chinese zodiac compatibility rules, people born in the Year of the Dragon could get along well with Rooster, Rat, and Monkey people; a happy married life would be likely. However, people of Ox, Sheep, or Dog signs should be avoided when choosing a life partner. Perfect Matches 
People born in the Year of the Dog possess the best traits of human nature. They are honest, friendly, faithful, loyal, smart, straightforward, venerable and have a strong sense of responsibility. On the negative side, they are likely to be self-righteous, cold, terribly stubborn, slippery, critical of others and not good at social activities. 
I am 1991 Aries, Sheep Husband is 1992 Aquarius, Sheep/Monkey Hybrid Son is 2016 Libra, Monkey. (Let me know if you need Birthdays.) Also I have seen a lot of love compatibility charts, but much on parent/child/family compatibility information out there. Is it the same? Should I refer to the love compatibility charts for family planning as well? 
Hello, (I am sorry for my English) I would like to ask you about compatibility of Chinese zodiac. I am Chinese Rooster Water Jin and I desperately fall in love with man Tiger Fire Jang. When I first met him I know that this is something exceptional, but unfortunately I immediately know (somehow) that it wouldn't work for us.
