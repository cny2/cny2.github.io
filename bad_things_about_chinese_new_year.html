Last Updated on 2023-01-10 , 5:08 pm. Many of us have probably forgotten about some of the taboos and traditions that we have to follow during the Chinese New Year period every year, so we’ve taken the liberty of collating 10 taboos that you must never commit on Chinese New Year, or your entire year might be suay. 
9. Do not give New Year blessings to someone still in bed. You are supposed to give New Year blessings (拜年 / bài nián). But let the recipient get up from bed first. Otherwise, they’ll be bed-ridden for the entire year. You also shouldn’t tell someone to wake up. You don’t want them to be rushed around or bossed for the year. 
The Chinese New Year taboos mentioned above are widely observed throughout the entire Lunar New Year celebration. Keep reading to learn about more Chinese New Year taboos day by day from the Chinese New Year's Eve. 10. Don't Eat All of the Fish. Fish is a must-have dish at the Chinese New Year's Eve dinner. It's a homophone for the word  
Chinese New Year is a joyful and harmonious festival, but there are some traditional superstitions and taboos as doing them may bring bad luck. The Spring Festival typically lasts for 15 days , some things are forbidden throughout the entire festive period. 
Chinese people take Spring Festival (Chinese Lunar New Year) as the foretaste of the whole year's fortune. For the sake of a safe and smooth year, people practice many New Year customs and taboos in folk China. For example, washing hair, putting on ragged clothes, and turning pockets inside out. 
For Chinese people, Lunar New Year is the Spring Festival,  wishing to cut away last year’s bad luck and walk out with a clean, shiny slate. Then it’s no washing for 24 hours, to avoid  
During Chinese New Year, people have a long list of things to do. From one week preceding the festival to the 15th day after, many Chinese New Year customs are widely observed for thousands of years. The family reunion dinner, eating dumplings, and setting off firework are the must-dos that you might know. What else interesting do the Chinese do? 
This year marks the Year of the Snake, as every Chinese New Year corresponds to one of the 12 animals in the Chinese Zodiac. Let’s explore the dos and don'ts of this auspicious festival. 
However, cleaning the house before Chinese New Year is important for another reason —- getting rid of bad luck. Make sure to do a full sweep, and clear out all the unfortunate things that have happened in the past year, leaving your house open to good fortune once the celebrations begin. 
13. Watching the CCTV New Year’s Gala. On the eve of Chinese New Year, millions of people across China and beyond tune in to watch the CCTV New Year’s Gala. This televised variety show features a wide array of performances, including music, dance, comedy, acrobatics, and more. 
4. Why Doesn't Chinese New Year Fall on New Year's Day? Chinese New Year is never on January 1. Chinese have a different traditional date for New Year. Chinese New Year's date is determined by the Chinese lunar calendar, which is always 21–51 days behind the corresponding Gregorian (international) calendar date.
