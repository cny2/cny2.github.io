In addition, there were many interactive sessions to introduce Chinese New Year customs and Chinese zodiac culture. I also participated in making lanterns and red envelopes for the first time. On 6th February, the Confucius Institute held their second Chinese New Year Carnival to celebrate Chinese New Year on Market Street in Lancaster City Centre. 
Traditionally, Chinese people would be having the show night before the New Year Day to wish everyone good luck in the new year and family could watch the performance together. Hence, we would like to highlight the idea of Reunion and Blessing through this show to everyone in Lancaster.
