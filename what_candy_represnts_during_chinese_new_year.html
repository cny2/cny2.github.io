A Chinese candy box (全 盒, or chuen hup/zan hup) is a traditional box used during Chinese New Year for storing candy and other edible goods. Its existence dates as far back as the Ming Dynasty in 1567. [1] The box usually has a lid; some are more fancy and elaborate than others.

These culinary elements are not merely sustenance but are embedded with wishes for prosperity, longevity, and unity among family members. </p>
