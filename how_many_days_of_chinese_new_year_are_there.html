        <p>The Chinese New Year of 2025 falls on January 29th (Wednesday), and will last to February 2nd. It is the Year of Snake. As an official public holiday, Chinese people can get eight days' off from work, from January 28th to February 4th. The Chinese New Year of 2026 falls on February 17th (Tuesday), and will last to February 21th. It is the Year  
Rather than following the western Gregorian Calendar with 365-day years, the Chinese New Year follows a lunar calendar based the moon's 12 phases. Each phase cycle spans approximately 29 days with  
Chinese New Year, or the Spring Festival (see also § Names), is a festival that celebrates the beginning of a new year on the traditional lunisolar Chinese calendar. 
But Chinese people typically view the entire 15 days following 除夕 (chú xī) as the New Year Festival, and so the celebratory activities continuously span from 除夕 (chú xī) all the way to 正月十五 (zhēng yuè shí wǔ) - the 15th day of the first lunar month. 
Chinese New Year or Lunar New Year celebration usually lasts 15 days, from New Year's Eve to the 15th day of the Chinese New Year—the Lantern Festival. In 2025, the celebration starts on Jan. 28th and ends on Feb. 12th. 
Chinese New Year, also known as Spring Festival or Lunar New Year, is the grandest festival in China, usually with a 8 days' holiday. As the most colorful annual event, the traditional CNY celebration lasts longer, up to two weeks, and the climax arrives around the Lunar New Year's Eve. 
Chinese New Year starts with the New moon on the first day of the first lunar month and ends on the Full moon 15 days later. The festival traditionally begins on the first day of the first lunar month (Traditional Chinese: 正月; Pinyin: zhēngyuè) in the Chinese calendar and ends on the 15th; this day is called Lantern Festival. 
Lunar New Year celebrations can last up to 15 days, starting on the new moon between late January and mid-February.  Lunar New Year, or Chinese New Year, falls this year on Wednesday, Jan. 29  
Unlike the Western calendar, each month in the lunar calendar is 29 or 30 days, because the average frequency of each new moon cycle is 29.53059 days. This is sometimes rounded up to 30, sometimes down to 29. This means that the lunar calendar, which also has 12 months, is only 354 or 355 days. 
Why does Chinese New Year last 15 days? Chinese New Year celebrations typically last up to 16 days, but only the first seven days are considered public holidays – from Jan. 29 to Feb. 4 this year. 
Chinese New Year (Lunar New Year) is celebrated for sixteen days (from Chinese New Year's Eve to Chinese Lantern Festival). The preparations start half a month before Chinese New Year's Eve. Many celebration activities for this period are traditional customs, but some are quite new Chinese New Year 2025 falls on January 29th, 2025.
