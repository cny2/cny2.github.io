        <h2><strong>pineapple cake chinese new year chinese new year 2025 early years</strong></h2>
        <p>Chinese pineapple cakes (鳳梨酥, pronounced Feng Li Su) are a famous pastry in Taiwan. Usually square-shaped, it has a buttery, shortbread-like casing with a pineapple filling similar to a very thick jam. It is often served and gifted around Lunar New Year and for years I’ve been wanting to attempt to make my own.

Make the pastry dough. In a bowl, whisk together together the all-purpose flour, almond flour and milk powder. Set aside. In a stand mixer bowl fitted with a paddle attachment, cream the butter and icing sugar until light and fluffy. 
2. Take a small dough, put it in the palm and flatten it, wrap it with 15 grams of pineapple filling, and close while turning. 3. Put the stuffed dough into a square mold, press the edge of the mold with one hand and press the dough firmly against the surface of the pan, then put the mold into the baking tray together. 
Every year in late January, or early February, someone would bring in these little squares of pineapple filled delights for Chinese New Year. Though these pineapple tarts (cakes) can be enjoyed year round they are a tradition for the Lunar Year. The recipe is easy to make, but reducing the pineapple takes some time.

Instructions. Cut the pineapple flesh into small cubes. Blend the pineapple flesh into a puree. Gently heat the puree in a pan until it starts to boil.
