        <h2><strong>harbin in chinese new year chinese new year festival at central plaza california</strong></h2>
        <p>The annual Harbin Ice and Snow Festival opens in December and lasts for around 2 months, till late February of the next year. Find out activities, travel tips, constructions, history, etc of the ice festival China. 
At the Harbin Ice-Snow World, a theme park dedicated to the Asian Winter Games, visitors are treated with a spectacular drone show celebrating the Chinese New Year. The park also features a variety of ice sculptures with festive themes, including a carp symbolizing prosperity and the Chinese character Fu (meaning good fortune) carved in ice. 
The New Paris Hotel, located on Zhongshan Road in Harbin, is one of the designated media reception hotels. Inside, red lanterns and festive couplets contribute to a vibrant New Year atmosphere. 
It is expected to last from January 5 to March of 2025, covering three important Chinese festivals – New Year's Day, Chinese New Year and Lantern Festival. A variety of activities about ice and snow, concerning tourism, culture, fashion, the economy and trade and sports, will welcom all tourists. 
In 2024 we travelled to China mid-February, with a big dream of visiting Ice and Snow Festival in Harbin. We were surprised that the train was completely empty on the way there, bacause it was right after the Chinese New Year, still during the travel rush. 
Curiously, my arrival to Harbin also happened at the same time of the Chinese New Year, which made my stay in this cold city even more memorable than before. Now, when it comes to the festival itself, these are several events happening for a whole period of 2 months all over the city. 
The New Year Day and Chinese Spring Festival also take place during the ice and snow festival when many interesting activities related to traditional Chinese culture will be organized. Advice on The Best Time to Enjoy the Festival : If you want to take part in all kinds of activities and events, you can choose late December ~ early January to come. 
Special Events: • New Year’s Day Polar Plunge: January 1, 2025 • International Competition: January 20, 2025 • Festival Finale Swim: February 28, 2025; Practical Timing Tips and Considerations. Making the most of your trip to the Harbin Ice Festival involves careful planning beyond the festival grounds. 
Tips: you might encounter large crowds and long queues if traveling during China's public holidays: December 31st to January 2nd for New Year's Day and January 28th to February 3th in 2025 for China's Spring Festival. A private tour or a small group tour are even-more-recommended during these periods. 
During the three-day New Year's Day holidays, from December 30 to January 1, Harbin welcomed more than 3 million tourists, generating tourism revenue of about 5.91 billion yuan ($832 million  
Answer 1 of 10: Hi TripAdvisor community, My family is travelling to Harbin next week, and we will be there the evening of the 27th and day of the 28th. Will there be any events happening for Chinese New Year that we should attend?

Every year as the clock nears midnight on December 31, the eyes of the world turn once more to the fantastic Harbin Ice and Snow World. Anticipation runs high. New Year's Eve at this theme park has become more than just a celebration — it's a tradition of the annual Harbin International Ice and Snow Sculpture Festival. 
The Chinese New Year is forthcoming, in the snowflakes dancing in the air, the festival atmosphere of Harbin is getting stronger. Fu (good fortune) words, Spring Festival couplets, lanterns and other New Year supplies continue hot sale, and fiery-red Fu words set off the encouraging festive atmosphere. 
Unlike most of the other Chinese Traditional Festival sets, which reference and commemorate key Chinese New Year traditions, there isn’t a tradition where we all go ice skating at Chinese New Year. The inspiration for the set is a very China-centric one – the Harbin International Ice and Snow Sculpture Festival , a massive winter wonderland  
China has seven legal holidays in a year, including New Year's Day, Chinese New Year (Spring Festival), Qingming Festival (Tomb-sweeping Day), May Day, Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Day and National Day. Chinese people enjoy 13 days off in total for these official holidays. 
When 500 grand scarlet lanterns illuminate the century-old Harbin Central Avenue, the festive atmosphere in Harbin is instantly elevated. Symbolizing auspiciousness, these lanterns infuse the old street with a vibrant and celebratory ambiance, permeating every corner with a sense of harmony and joy as the Chinese New Year approaches. 
The two longest holidays, each with seven days off, are the Chinese New Year in late January or early February, and the National Day holiday from Oct. 1st to 7th. Special attention should be paid to the former, for it coincides with the best time to visit Harbin mentioned above. See more about the National Holidays in China
