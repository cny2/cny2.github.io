Food plays an important role in Chinese New Year and certain foods which have symbolic meanings of luck and auspiciousness are especially popular and essential during the festival.

The fruits are given as gifts, their round shape and gold color said to symbolize prosperity and bring the recipient good fortune throughout the year. 
1. Chinese Dumplings — For Wealth. The Chinese Dumplings symbolize wealth, and eating them on the New Year can bring abundance, prosperity, and good luck..

The Chinese New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, is a time of joy, family reunions, and, of course, indulging in delicious food. Each dish served during this festive period carries a special meaning, symbolizing prosperity, luck, and togetherness. 
In the Chinese calendar, food isn’t just for celebration—it’s also a way to bring luck, prosperity, and good health into your life. The Reunion Dinner is the highlight of Chinese New Year, a special moment for families to come together and enjoy a meal where every dish has a deeper meaning.

7. Grapes – A Year Full of Abundance. Grapes are another important fruit for New Year’s Eve. The tradition says that if you manage to eat 12 grapes at midnight, one for each month of the year, you’ll have good luck in the year ahead. This tradition dates back to the 1880s and is still going strong.
