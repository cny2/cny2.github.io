        <p>Students in Rochester — and around New York state — won’t be in class on Jan. 29 in recognition of the latest school holiday. Lunar New Year, also known as Chinese New Year, is celebrated on  
In many Asian countries, it is a festival that is celebrated for several days. In diaspora communities, particularly in cultural enclaves, Lunar New Year is visibly and joyfully celebrated. In the Chinese zodiac, 2025 is the Year of the Snake. Different countries across Asia celebrate the new year in many ways and may follow a different zodiac. 
Parents across New York might wonder why their kids don’t have school on Wednesday, Jan. 29, well, the Lunar New Year is to thank for that and a declaration by Governor Kathy Hochul in 2024. 
New York Governor Kathy Hochul passed the legislation in September 2023 making Lunar New Year, also known as the Chinese New Year, an official holiday for public schools in New York state. Last year’s Lunar New Year fell on a Saturday when school was not in session. The Lunar New Year celebrates the first new moon of the lunar calendar and  
The holiday falls on different dates each year because of the use of the lunisolar calendar, which is based on the position of the Moon and Sun. "We are setting a valuable example for other states to follow," Assemblymember Grace Lee (D), said in a statement when New York passed legislation in 2023 to mandate that schools close for the Lunar  
Assemblymember Edward Braunstein said, "Establishing Lunar New Year as a statewide public-school holiday in New York is a landmark achievement, and I was proud to support this effort in the Assembly. A statewide school holiday will allow those who observe the holiday to celebrate with their families, as well as give all New Yorkers the  
This also makes New York the first state to mandate school closures for the occasion. Last year, the state holiday’s inception fell on a Saturday, and students weren’t given an additional day off. 
The new law would ensure schools are not in session on Lunar New Year. “By designating Lunar New Year as an official school holiday, we are taking an important step in recognizing the importance of New York’s AAPI community and the rich diversity that makes New York so great,” Hochul said. 
Public schools across New York will close on Jan. 29 in observance of the Lunar New Year, following a 2023 state law signed by Gov. Kathy Hochul. The legislation recognizes the cultural and historical significance of the holiday celebrated by many Asian communities. Sponsored by Assemblyman William  
The Lunar New Year begins with the new moon on the first day of the lunar calendar, which falls on January 28, 2025. The festival lasts for 15 days , ending with the first full moon of the new year. 
Lunar New Year celebrates the beginning of spring and the new year on the lunisolar calendar. It is a major holiday in China and is also celebrated in other countries, including Vietnam and South  
Pre-Chinese New Year Preparations and Activities (Jan. 7–Feb. 12, 2025) Jan. 7, 2025: Laba Festival. Some Chinese start to celebrate and prepare for Chinese New Year as early as day 8 of the 12 th month of the lunar calendar. 
The legal holiday is seven days long, from the Lunar New Year's Eve to the sixth day of the first lunar month. Some companies and public institutions enjoy a longer holiday up to 10 days or more, because in common knowledge among Chinese people, the festival lasts longer, from the Lunar New Year's Eve to the 15th day of the first lunar month (Lantern Festival). 
The Asian Community Service Center is delighted to present its 15th Annual Chinese New Year Festival. The festival has become the most anticipated event during the Chinese New Year, and welcome to be a part of it in 2024 again.Every year around 4,000 people attend this friendly, community-oriented event. 
Planning a Chinese New Year celebration is a great way for your class to get to find out all of the fun elements of Chinese New Year, from traditional food to parades and fireworks. Hold a Chinese New Year assembly – introduce the rest of the school to what your pupils have learnt – this is a great opportunity for your pupils to share their  
If you’re the one handing out red pockets, try not to be so blunt. Chinese culture emphasizes soft and suave tactics. Rather than saying “here’s your lucky money,” try telling the child: Happy New Year! Wish you success in school! Hope you have a great year! It’s best to make sure the parents see you give the money.
