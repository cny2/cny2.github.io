With various developments and progress over time, the Chinese New Year has gradually developed into a globalized festival. The celebrants divided into three main groups, including Asians who live abroad in America and Europe, the older native Chinese, and the younger generation in China.

coming new year. 1.1.3 Family Reunion dinner Chinese New Year is a happy and peaceful holiday, also known as the days of family reunion.

Chinese New Year (农历新年 nónglì xīn nián) is the official name for Chinese New Year in the Republic of China (Taiwan), while Spring Festival (春节Chūn Jié) or the Lunar New Year, is the festival that celebrates the beginning of a Chinese New Year in P.R. China.

MLA Works Cited Examples Works Cited Rubric. The criteria for evaluating a works cited page may vary across academic and professional disciplines. The rubric below distinguishes failing works cited pages from passing works cited pages. In this framework, a professional works cited list shows a sensitivity to the ongoing scholarly conversations  
In its publications, the MLA prefers to provide works-cited-list entries in the original script, along with a translation and sometimes a transliteration, for works not written in roman characters (see our previous post). In a teaching context, however, it is fine to allow students to provide works-cited-list entries in English only. 
From a references list or "works cited" list, we can see if a student have used primary sources, the subject scope of his research finds, the type of resrouces used (book, journal/periodical, multi-media, website, etc.) and if the student has the ability attends to details. I usually look the references/works cited page first.

😕 What is a Works Cited Generator? A works cited generator is a tool that automatically creates a works cited page in the Modern Language Association (MLA) citation format. The generator will take in information about the sources you have cited in your paper, such as document titles, authors, and URLs, and will output a fully formatted works cited page that can be added to the end of your  
In MLA, you must "cite" sources that you have paraphrased, quoted or otherwise used to write your research paper. Cite your sources in two places: In the body of your paper where you add a brief in-text citation. In the Works Cited list at the end of your paper where you give more complete information for the source.
