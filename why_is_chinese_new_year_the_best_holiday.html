        <p>Why Teach Chinese New Year: Exploring the Cultural Significance and Educational Benefits. Chinese New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, is one of the most important traditional Chinese holidays. It is a time for families to reunite, celebrate, and usher in a new year filled with good fortune and prosperity. 
Why is Chinese New Year so important? For me, Chinese New Year is more than just another holiday. It’s a time for family, food, and fresh starts. It’s the most important festival in China, and it’s all about saying goodbye to the past year and welcoming new opportunities, prosperity, and happiness. What I love most are the traditions. 
One of the most colourful Chinese traditions of Chinese New Year, (literally, because the costumes are supposed to draw the eye) the lion dance is an essential part of the festive atmosphere that  
4. Why Doesn't Chinese New Year Fall on New Year's Day? Chinese New Year is never on January 1. Chinese have a different traditional date for New Year. Chinese New Year's date is determined by the Chinese lunar calendar, which is always 21–51 days behind the corresponding Gregorian (international) calendar date. 
The highlight of the celebration is Chinese New Year's Eve, when families gather for a reunion feast of symbolic foods, including dumplings shaped like ancient Chinese gold ingots that represent wealth, and fish, which in Chinese is a homonym of "abundance." The fish must be only partially eaten because the leftovers signify continuing prosperity. 
Honoring the dead is a Chinese New Year's tradition that's kept to the word. Many Chinese people visit ancestors' graves on the day before the Chinese New Year's day, offer sacrifices to ancestors before the reunion dinner (to show that they are letting their ancestors "eat" first), and add an extra glass and place it at the dinner table on New Year's eve. 
In 1912, the government decided to abolish Chinese New Year and the lunar calendar, but adopted the Gregorian calendar instead and made January 1 the official start of the new year. After 1949, Chinese New Year was renamed to the Spring Festival. It was listed as a nationwide public holiday. 
The holiday is not celebrated just in mainland China and Hong Kong. For Chinese people, Lunar New Year is the Spring Festival,  the best bet for participating is at fairs inside temples in Beijing. 
The holiday is sometimes called the Lunar New Year because the dates of celebration follow the phases of the moon. Since the mid-1990s people in China have been given seven consecutive days off work during the Chinese New Year. 
How is Chinese New Year celebrated? Spring Festival is a time for families to come together, exchange money-filled red envelopes (红包, hóngbāo), and enjoy delicious Chinese food. The Chinese New Year is a 15-day holiday and includes a variety of festivities depending on the region and its local traditions and customs.

The date varies because Chinese New Year, like many other traditional Chinese holidays (like the Autumn Moon Festival) is based on the traditional lunar calendar, which shifts every year in accordance with the phases of the moon as opposed to the standardized Gregorian calendar.
