        <h2><strong>why vietnamese celebrate chinese new year blessed chinese new year eve</strong></h2>
        <p>After living in China for 3 years as V-Trust Sales Manager and 1 year in Vietnam as V-Trust Country Manager, I am happy to share my experience and feelings, even if, for sure, I don’t know everything and they may not be exhaustive. Chinese New Year and the Vietnamese New Year (called Tết in Vietnam) actually have a lot in common. 
Vietnamese New Year, known as Tết Nguyên Đán or simply Tết, has its roots in ancient Vietnamese agrarian traditions and the lunar calendar, influenced by Chinese culture. Dating back over 2,000 years, Tết originally marked the beginning of the farming cycle, celebrating the arrival of spring and paying respect to ancestors and deities. 
No Tết celebration is complete without a mention of the Vietnamese zodiac. Like its Chinese counterpart, the Vietnamese zodiac is a 12-year cycle where each year is associated with an animal. However, Vietnam adds its own unique twist to this tradition. The Rabbit is replaced by the Cat, believed to bring a sense of calmness and prosperity. 
The Vietnamese New Year celebration of Tet, short for Tet Nguyen Dan which means “festival of the first day”, is celebrated over three days as opposed to the traditional 15 of the Chinese New  
While similar to the Chinese Lunar New Year, Tết has distinct traditions and cultural significance unique to Vietnam. The holiday’s origins date back to the 18th century B.C., influenced by Chinese culture, though it has evolved over centuries to reflect Vietnam’s unique customs. 
4. Vietnamese New Year Is Different from Chinese New Year. 5. Vietnamese New Year Is Celebrated Either in January or February. 6. Tet Celebrations Last Much Longer than the 7-Day Public Holiday. 7. Honoring Ong Tao Marks the Beginning of Vietnamese Lunar New Year. 8. Preparation for Lunar New Year Begins Weeks in Advance. 9. 
Originally, the holiday marks the first full moon of the new lunar year and the end of the Chinese New Year. In some other Asian countries such as Thailand or Laos, the festival is celebrated around late October or early November to mark the end of the Buddhist Lent &amp; the beginning of the festive season. 
The Vietnamese New Year was first celebrated by the Chinese in Vietnam over 2000 years ago. At that time, Vietnam was part of Ancient China and so the Chinese New Year transcended generations to become the Vietnamese New Year. The Tet festival was originally a three-day celebration, but it has gradually expanded to last up to two weeks. 
The first period is referred to as “tat nien.” This includes the days leading up to New Year’s Eve. Traditionally, this time is reserved specifically for family reunions, cooking, and making preparations for upcoming celebrations. New Year’s Eve, the most sacred time of the year for many, is called “giao thua.” 
Vietnamese people believe that the joyous first days of the year signal a prosperous year ahead. The passing of the old year leaves behind bad luck, and the new year brings hope and optimism. If the previous year was lucky, that luck is believed to carry over into the next. In this sense, Tet is a day filled with optimism and hope for the future. 
Vietnamese New Year or Vietnamese Lunar New Year is called Tết or Tết Nguyên Đán or also Tết Âm Lịch in Vietnamese. It’s the most important event of the year in Vietnam. If you are new to Tết, you can have a look at my previous article to better understand what is Tet and why it’s so important to Vietnamese people. 
Instead, the New Year should be called Tết in Vietnam, or simply the Lunar New Year, rather than “Chinese New Year”. 16) Vietnamese Superstitions Around the Lunar New Year. The Vietnamese New Year is a very auspicious day, and good things that happen to them on the first day of the year will set the stage for the remainder of the year. 
If given a place to celebrate the traditional New Year in three countries, Westerners prefer to go to Beijing, Seoul and Ho Chi Minh City. On Quora, a foreign visitor was curious about the similarities and differences between the Lunar New Year of three Asian countries, Vietnam - China - Korea. 
In a word, no. Tet is lunar new year, or you might know it as Chinese New Year. It occurs on a different day every year, since it marks the night of the first new moon of the year, sometime between January 21st and February 20th. If you’re planning a trip to Vietnam during Tet, read on to find out why this is not a good idea. 
In the present day, Vietnamese religious believe that every 23rd day of December in the Lunar New Year (January 25, 2022), the three gods would travel up to the heavens to relay information to the Jade Emperor and pray for prosperity in the coming year. 
This Lunar New Year, the Vietnamese will observe a different animal in the zodiac, the cat. The reasons are murky: could be linguistics or the landscape — or maybe cats are just plain friendlier. 
Lunar New Year marks the beginning of a new year on China's traditional lunisolar calendar. It is a time for family gatherings. It is the most important festival in China (where it is known as Chinese New Year or Spring Festival), and it is also widely celebrated in South Korea (where it is known as Seollal), in Vietnam (as Tet), as well as Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, and other countries  
Tết Nguyên Đán or the Vietnamese Lunar New Year celebrates the arrival of spring and marks the beginning of a new year according to the Vietnamese lunar calendar. During Tết, Vietnamese families honor their ancestors, exchange gifts, and enjoy special foods as they look forward to a year of prosperity and good fortune. 
Originally, the holiday marks the first full moon of the new lunar year and the end of the Chinese New Year. In some other Asian countries such as Thailand or Laos, the festival is celebrated around late October or early November to mark the end of the Buddhist Lent &amp; the beginning of the festive season. 
China ruled Vietnam for a thousand years, so you can say we inherited a few things. A big thing was Chinese New Year, which we Vietnamese call Tet.. And although the Chinese zodiac says Sunday  </p>
