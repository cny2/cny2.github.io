        <p>Once again, Lunar New Year is on Sunday, January 22. Sarah’s running the show here tomorrow so my wishes are coming early. May the Year of the Rabbit bring kindness and peace. Wishing all of you a smooth flow and a sweet ride. HAPPY NEW YEAR! GUNG HAY FAT CHOY! Yours in gossip, Lainey 
It’s been years since I’ve had “poon choi”, I can’t f-cking wait. And I also can’t wait for the take-home, because ma has been cooking for days: soups, turnip cake, taro cake, jujube fruit pudding, and Buddha’s Delight, which many Chinese eat on New Year’s Day to observe the old purification custom at the start of the new year. 
Dear Gossips, Lunar New Year is exactly a week away, on Tuesday, February 1, so for those of us who observe it, this is your heads up. And for those of you who’ve been visiting this site over the years, a quick reminder about the pre-Lunar New Year tasks that are commonly performed as we make the transition from the Ox to the Tiger. 
Enter the Dragon Lainey. Honoured to be back as host for the @fetechinoise Lunar New Year Gala, the most auspicious party of the year! at the @parkhyattto. Thanks to @mr1loveto for being the best date and dressing on theme! As my ma would say - you are #1 top best choice style. May the Dragon breathe peace and good health and happiness.

Chinese New Year is so rich in karmic symbolism that Lainey Lui rarely makes future plans until the holiday has come and gone. "I can't make goals until I know what my horoscope is going to look  
To celebrate the Lunar New Year, gossip blogger Elaine Lui enlists her ma (A.K.A the Squawking Chicken) to predict the year ahead for each of the 12 signs of the Chinese zodiac.To read about their  
The page will turn in the Lunar calendar on Wednesday, ushering out the Year of the Dragon and ushering in the Year of the Snake. We spoke to Paul Ng, a geomancer—a specialized kind of prophecy based on the patterns in a handful of dirt—and philosopher whose Lunar New Year forecasts are highly sought after, both at home in Canada and abroad. 
Highlights and lowlights of the year in Gossip 2023. Dear Squawkers, What I really wanted was for Jacek, or someone at Substack, to design an interactive gossip advent calendar for this week’s newsletter, with 24 boxes, and some of sort of digital wheel, asking users to click and spin, and the number you land on opens up one of 24 gossip highlights from the year that was.

Sunday February 14th. It’s a big day. It’s Chinese New Year. Very, very important. Of course, because she’s so spiritual, and because she’s, like, totally Asian and knows how to take all the calories out of an Asian salad, and brown rices everything, this week’s GOOP newsletter is all about the Year of the Tiger. 
Today is the 6th day of the 12 Days of Chinese New Year and the spotlight is on the Tiger. The Tiger and the Monkey are not compatible so, for Tigers, there may be challenges. My ma, the Chinese Squawking Chicken, is a Tiger. In our family, we’ve been bracing for some more bullsh-t. That said, the Tiger can be protected by the Rat and the Dragon. 
Get rid of last year’s remains, get everything fresh for the New Year so that good luck will be attracted to your home. Also don’t forget to wash your car. Just wanted to make sure you don’t get caught up in all that football you’re left scrambling to clear out the Goat to make way for the Monkey. The 12 Days of Chinese New Year  
Let’s continue with the 12 Days of Chinese New Year. Today it’s the Dog. Last year for Dogs was a year of learning. The Year of the Monkey will be unpredictable and there’s no lucky star to help you. So Dogs must guard their luck. Be very strategic with when you want to spend it. Only push when you are totally sure it’s the right time. 
Once again, Lunar New Year is on Sunday, January 22. Sarah’s running the show here tomorrow so my wishes are coming early. May the Year of the Rabbit bring kindness and peace. Wishing all of you a smooth flow and a sweet ride. HAPPY NEW YEAR! GUNG HAY FAT CHOY! Yours in gossip, Lainey 
We are now 12 days away from Chinese New Year. And we continue the 12 Days of Chinese New Year with the Rat. Rats could enjoy good luck this year but will not be successful alone. Rats will need assistance from the Ox, the Dragon, or the Monkey. So if you’re a Rat, your luck will increase if there are Oxen, Dragons, or Monkeys in your life. 
As you know, it was Chinese New Year’s Day yesterday. We are in full New Year festival spirits for the next week or so. To celebrate the Year of the Snake, China threw what must have been a sh-tload of money at Celine Dion to have her sing at their state televised gala on Saturday 
Dear Gossips, Lunar New Year is ten days from now, on Friday, February 12. It will be the Year of the Ox. My ma has some thoughts on this in the days to come but since so many of us are in lockdown and some things require more planning and preparation than in previous years, with certain businesses closed or offering limited services, maybe an advance reminder would be helpful for traditions  
Speaking of Taylor, Eras may be over, but her new era is just beginning—the Year of the Snake begins on Wednesday, the lunar new year. Taylor is a Snake, Reputation is her snake-era album, and many people are calling her gameday outfit “ Reputation coded” as if it’s an Easter egg that Reputation (Taylor’s Version) is coming. 
GUNG HAY FAT CHOY! Today is Lunar New Year’s Eve. Tomorrow begins the Year of the Rat! The Rat is the first sign in the Chinese zodiac which means that we are entering a new twelve year cycle on the Chinese astrological dial. And that seems fitting for a certain royal born under the sign of the Rat: Prince Harry. </p>
