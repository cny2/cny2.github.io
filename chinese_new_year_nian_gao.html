The Foundation Bricks Legend. Nian Gao has another legend about its origin, dating back to around 2,500 years ago:. Legend has it that, after the death of Wu Zixu (伍子胥, 559–484 BC), a general and politician of the Wu kingdom in the Spring and Autumn Period (771–476 BC), the king of Yue, Goujian, attacked the capital of Wu, and the Wu army and citizens were trapped in the city and  
Pan Frying Nian Gao: The best way to enjoy the nian gao is to pan fry it. Once the nian gao hardens overnight, it is easier to slice. Cut the cake into 1/4 to 1/2-inch thick slices.

They used their hands to mix the glutinous rice flour and sugar into a paste-like texture and pour them into a container with banana leaves, then steaming them over the stove for 1-1.5 hours depending on how deep the pan you use.
