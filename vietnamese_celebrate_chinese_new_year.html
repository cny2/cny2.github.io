        <h2><strong>vietnamese celebrate chinese new year when was chinese new year in 2000</strong></h2>
        <p>Vietnamese New Year, known as Tết Nguyên Đán or simply Tết, has its roots in ancient Vietnamese agrarian traditions and the lunar calendar, influenced by Chinese culture. Dating back over 2,000 years, Tết originally marked the beginning of the farming cycle, celebrating the arrival of spring and paying respect to ancestors and deities.

Considered the first day of spring and most important of national holidays in Vietnam, Tet is the annual Vietnamese New Year celebration, coinciding with the Lunar New Year celebrated throughout the world in January or February. 
The Vietnamese New Year was first celebrated by the Chinese in Vietnam over 2000 years ago. At that time, Vietnam was part of Ancient China and so the Chinese New Year transcended generations to become the Vietnamese New Year.

Yet, there may be differences due to time zone offsets. For example, the Chinese Lunar New Year will be 1 hour or 1 day later than the Vietnamese Lunar New Year. Interestingly, the Vietnamese usually start Tet preparations two weeks or even a month before, creating a buzzing atmosphere at the spring entrance. 
Originally, the holiday marks the first full moon of the new lunar year and the end of the Chinese New Year. In some other Asian countries such as Thailand or Laos, the festival is celebrated around late October or early November to mark the end of the Buddhist Lent &amp; the beginning of the festive season.
