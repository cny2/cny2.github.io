Lunar New Year — which includes Chinese New Year, Seollal in Korea, Tet in Vietnam and more — begins on Jan. 29, kicking off more than two weeks of parties, customs and copious feasts. 
A typical year of 12 months needs to be supplemented with one intercalary or leap month every two to three years in the Chinese calendar. In the Chinese calendar, there are seven leap months in every cycle of 19 years. And the Year of the Snake has such a leap month, bringing the total number of days to 384. 
A leap month is inserted if there are 13 New Moons from the start of the 11th month in the first year to the start of the 11th month in the next year. The Chinese calendar uses a solar term system that has 12 principal terms to indicate when the Sun's longitudes is a multiple of 30 degrees. 
This year, Lunar New Year begins Jan. 29. Because the lunar calendar is based on the phases of the moon, the beginning of the year happens on a different day each year. 
The seventh day of the Lunar New Year (February 4, 2025) is said to be when the Chinese mother goddess, Nuwa, created humanity. Thus, it’s called renri/jan jat (the people’s birthday). 
The traditional Chinese lunisolar year has 12 months and 353 to 355 days (or during a leap year, 13 months and 383 to 385 days). Therefore, the Chinese year usually begins several weeks into the Western 365-day year (usually between January 21 and February 20), not on January 1 of the Gregorian calendar. 
The Chinese New Year of 2025 falls on January 29th (Wednesday), and will last to February 2nd. It is the Year of Snake. As an official public holiday, Chinese people can get eight days' off from work, from January 28th to February 4th. The Chinese New Year of 2026 falls on February 17th (Tuesday), and will last to February 21th. It is the Year  
Chinese New Year Holiday 2025. Officially, the Chinese people will have a holiday for about 7 days from Chinese New Year's Eve to the sixth day of the lunar new year. In 2025, the Chinese New Year holiday lasts from January 28th to February 4th. Some companies may extend the holiday up to 16 days. 
Each Chinese lunar year has a Chinese zodiac sign animal. The Chinese zodiac year's stsarting date is a little different from the Gregorian year. It starts from Chinese New Year. The Chinese zodiac years chart below is provided to help you find out the exact starting and ending dates of the Chinese zodiac years. (This is especially useful for  
The most improtant festival in China, the Chinease New Year, the Spring Festival is coming. The Chinese New Year in 2024 falls on February 10th. Loong, or as westen world said the “Chinese dragon”, is a special simble in China, which is represent the power and auspicious sign. 
2024 is the Year of the Wood Dragon. Dragon is the 5th animal in the 12-year cycle of the Chinese zodiac signs, coming after the Rabbit and before the Snake. Recent years of the Dragon include 2024 (this year), 2012, 2000, 1988, 1976, 1964, and 1952, with the next Dragon year in 2036 (Year of the Fire Dragon). 
The Chinese New Year Day must be between January 21st and February 21st; The 11th, 12th and 1st lunar months shouldn't contain a Leap Month; If there are two Leap Months in a Lunar Year, then the first Leap Month after the Winter Solstice is considered intercalary. There are no strong astronomical reasons to make those rules for the Chinese

The second rule of thumb is that most of the time Chinese New Year will fall 11 (or sometimes 10 or 12) days earlier than the previous year, but if that means that the event would be outside of the Chinese New Year range of January 21 to February 21, a leap month must be added so Chinese New Year jumps 19 (or sometimes 18) days later.
