        <p>The Lunar New Year, also known as Chinese New Year is usually celebrated between late January and February, during the first new moon. This year, it will be on Wednesday, January 2025. But if you’re in Japan, you may be wondering, “Does Japan celebrate Chinese New Year?” Here’s what you should know. Does Japan Celebrate Chinese New Year? 
Chinese New Year is an annual festival originated in China and Chinese communities around the world celebrate the beginning of a new year based on the traditional Chinese calendar. The Chinese New Year starts on the new moon which appears sometime between January 21 and February 20. In 2024, it’s from February 10 to 17! During the Chinese New  
So, why is it that Japan does not celebrate Lunar New Year? Let’s find out. Has Japan Ever Celebrated The Lunar New Year? There was a time when Japan did celebrate the Lunar New Year. In the sixth century CE, the Chinese lunisolar calendar became the main way of timekeeping within Japan. This lasted until the year 1873. 
Modern-day Japan does not celebrate Lunar New Year the same way its neighbors do, but several shōgatsu traditions are similar due to their shared history. Both traditions emphasize cleaning the home before the first day of the new year to sweep away the problems of last year (called ōsōji 大掃除, or “big cleaning”). 
Though Japanese New Year no longer coincides with the Chinese Spring Festival, Japan still uses a 12-year zodiac that is very similar to the Chinese zodiac, and many nengajō feature the New Year’s zodiac animal. In 2019, Japan will celebrate the Year of the Boar. 
In the Chinese zodiac, each new year, according to the lunar calendar, is associated with one of 12 animals, and 2025 marks the Year of the Snake. Different regions in Asia may not follow the same  
TOKYO, Feb. 14 (Xinhua) -- From red lanterns to dancing dragons, from savoring Chinese delicacies to dragon year tales, vibrant celebrations for the Chinese Lunar New Year, or Spring Festival, have been held across multiple cities in Japan, allowing more people to immerse themselves in the festive atmosphere and experience the joy and charm of China's rich traditional culture. 
January is a special month in Japan, marking the start of a new year filled with celebrations. In the Kansai region, you’ll find historic events like the "Ebisu Festival," which prays for business prosperity, and the "Wakakusa Yamayaki" in Nara, an ancient tradition that signals the arrival of early spring. This guide highlights January’s top events and festivals in Kansai, including  
Here is our annual guide to help you understand New Year customs in Japan. 2025 is the Year of the Snake, according to the Chinese zodiac. New Year’s Eve - Omisoka (大晦日) Omisoka is the Japanese expression for New Year’s Eve.

The Countdown Cruise from Osaka Port is a popular event to ring in the New Year aboard the sailboat Santa Maria.Departing at 11:30 PM on December 31, the cruise lasts about an hour, touring highlights of the bay area such as the Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan and Universal Studios Japan. 
Why don’t the Japanese celebrate Lunar New Year like the rest of Asia? Unlike the Chinese (and the rest of Asia), Japan does not celebrate the lunar new year. Japan’s new year holiday is every January 1st in alignment with western calendars. In fact, Chinese New Year is known as 旧正月, or “old/former new year.” 
Any advice from those who’ve been in Japan during CNY or are familiar with the travelling habits of neighbouring countries during the Chinese New Year period would be much appreciated! I’m planning a trip to Japan in January 2025. Chinese New Year in 2025 is Wednesday 29th January. 
So, does Thailand celebrate the Lunar New Year? The simple answer is yes! In fact, as mentioned in the Hot Thai Kitchen Newsletter, Thailand is home to millions of people of Chinese descent; therefore, it comes as no surprise the country embraces this important festival with open arms. 
This is a fun tradition to carry out as you look forward to all the new year holds. Joya no Kane at the temple. This New Year tradition is held at Buddhist temples throughout the country and involves ringing in the New Year with the large temple bell. The ceremony starts before midnight at many temples, but at midnight at others. 
The district holds a massive lantern festival, just like in Yokohama, to celebrate the Lunar New Year, with over 15,000 gorgeous Chinese lanterns on display, from small intricate designs to massive lanterns in the shape of Chinese zodiac animals. 
This is the answer. When they changed the calendar to westernize, they followed suit with the New Year. Some people are still aware of lunar new year and will even do sthg like eat a special meal on the date. For example, my family had kenchinjiru on 旧正月 (old new year). Only my MIL who cooked the meal even mentioned it was old new year. 
Philippines - January 29, 2025 Festive celebrations marked the arrival of the Year of the Snake, as the Chinese-Filipino communities of Manila welcomed the Lunar New Year on Wednesday with  
As a result, the official New Year in Japan has been celebrated on January 1st since then, due to Western influence, instead of the New Year based on the lunar calendar (a.k.a., Chinese New Year). While Japan does not officially celebrate the Lunar New Year, it is still recognized and acknowledged by many Japanese people. 
Since the mid-1990s people in China have been given seven consecutive days off work during the Chinese New Year. This week of relaxation has been designated Spring Festival, a term that is sometimes used to refer to the Chinese New Year in general. The origins of the Chinese New Year are steeped in legend. One legend is that thousands of years  </p>
