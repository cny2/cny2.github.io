        <h2><strong>chinese new year golden week chinese new year music animal jam</strong></h2>
        <p>The Golden Week (simplified Chinese: 黄金周; traditional Chinese: 黃金週), in the People's Republic of China, is the name given to three separate 7-day or 8-day national holidays which were implemented in 2000: [1] Chunyun [disputed – discuss], the Golden Week around the Chinese New Year, begins in January or February. 
The other key “Golden Week” of holidays comes at the beginning of the year for Lunar New Year. At this time, huge proportions of the population travel to their home towns to reunite with family. While both Golden Week’s are massive and important across the country, the October Golden Week is generally regarded as a time to go on vacation  
Golden Week typically falls on the first week of October, but there might be a slight variation by a few days. This year, China’s National Day Golden Week falls on October 1 – 7, 2025. With millions of people traveling across the country, popular attractions become overcrowded, transportation is fully booked, and prices for hotels and  
Chinese New Year Holiday and National Day Holiday are the only two week-long holidays in China. During these two weeks, people enjoy themselves in a great variety of ways, contributing to a boost in tourism industry, hence the nickname 'Golden Week'. Hotel rooms, train tickets or air tickets will definitely be in great demand then. 
The first Golden Week coincides with the Lunar New Year, which marks the start of the Chinese lunar calendar, which is the largest and biggest celebration not just in China but in many other Asian countries as well. The second Golden Week takes place in October and is specific to China as it falls around National Day, a government holiday  
Golden Week is one of the two longest holidays in China, usually lasting from October 1st to 7th or 8th to celebrate Chinese National Day. During the holiday, Chinese people like traveling very much, making it the busiest time of a year in China’s tourism industry. 
Chinese National Day is celebrated on October 1st every year to commemorate the founding of People’s Republic of China. On that day, lots of large-scaled activities are held nationwide. The 7-day holiday from Oct. 1st to 7th is called 'Golden Week', during which a large number of Chinese people go traveling around the country. 
Golden Week is the longest national holiday in China after Chinese New Year. It is not a moveable holiday and falls every year from October 1 to 7. The period is long, so Golden Week is the perfect opportunity for Chinese people to relax and visit family living far away while businesses and factories remain closed. 
Many people have additional time off beyond the Golden Week, which means that the associated travel season lasts 40 days, from 15 days before Chinese New Year to 25 days after. For those 40 days, transportation will be extremely crowded and tickets may be hard to come by, even if you book well in advance. 
Lunar New Year is a festival beyond compare. Technically it’s a week—determined by the lunar calendar but always late January to mid-February—but for many, Chunjie (Spring Festival) is more  
As is traditional, the holiday schedule features two major week-long holidays: Spring Festival (also known as Chinese New Year) and the National Day holiday (often called ‘Golden Week’). In 2024, the Spring Festival falls between February 10 and 17, and the National Day holiday falls between October 1 and 7. 
The week has since become synonymous with mass travel and leisure activities, showcasing the vibrant culture and modern lifestyle of Chinese citizens. In addition to the National Day, the Spring Festival, which celebrates the lunar new year, also features a Golden Week. 
In October, the People's Republic of China celebrates its annual national holiday, known as Golden Week.Similar to Chinese New Year, the entire country is on holiday, resulting in business  
The Chinese Lunar year allows Chinese people to celebrate the Chinese New Year in the Chinese calendar. It takes place at the beginning of the year between January and February. On the other hand, the Chinese golden week takes place on the first seven days of October.

Each year in the Chinese calendar is represented by one of twelve animals in the Chinese Zodiac. According to the Chinese calendar, 2019 will be the year of the Pig – and will officially begin on February 5th. In the Western traditions, by this time in the year, most new year resolutions have been forgotten. 
There are two Golden Week holidays each year in China. The first occurs in January or February at Chinese New Year during the Spring Festival and the second occurs in early October around National Day. Check our public holiday schedule for this year’s exact dates.
