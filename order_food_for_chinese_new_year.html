While there are many ways to celebrate Lunar New Year with decorations, fireworks, and plenty of family time, the holiday isn’t complete without a special feast. 
Also called Spring Festival in most of mainland China, Lunar New Year begins on the night of the first new moon of the lunisolar calendar, which is a bit shorter than the 365-day solar year. The 16-day festival season is celebrated with lots of traditional Chinese New Year foods that are prepared, served and eaten in symbolic ways. 
Also known as Chinese New Year, Lunar New Year 2023 kicks off on Sunday, January 22, and ushers in the Year of the Rabbit. The 15-day celebration signifies the start of the lunar-solar calendar, a  
You may think “Lunar New Year” and “Chinese New Year” refer to the same event. That’s not the case! The Lunar New Year celebration in South Korea or Vietnam looks different than a celebration of the Lunar New Year in China. The holidays take place on different dates, too. In 2025, China begins to celebrate its Lunar New Year on  
Wednesday, January 29th, will kick off the start of the Year of the Snake with celebrations of fireworks, family, and feasts all across the world. 
The Chinese New Year, also known as Lunar New Year, is the most important festival in China: it lasts up to two weeks and is the only time of the year when China shuts down. Unlike Western countries, the Chinese New Year generally falls between January 21st and February 20th in the Gregorian calendar, according to the Chinese lunar calendar. 
Food is one of the things that the Chinese take the most pride in. And of course, a lot of care and thought is put into the menu for the most important holiday of the year. As with Chinese New Year activities and decorations, the dishes are created to give blessings for the next year. 
Hot Pot, Hot Pot! 120 S Atlantic Blvd Monterey Park, CA 91754. The tradition surrounding eating hot pot during Lunar New Year is quite special. Hot pot brings loved ones together to enjoy food from a communal broth, where everyone is engaged in assembling and cooking ingredients together. 
BETTER THAN TAKEOUT – Chicken Wonton Soup Recipe. Wonton, homonymous with “chaos”, meaning the chaos before the new beginning, and eating wonton symbolizes the new beginning. 
Yeah, it’s because Chinese food restaurants have typically been the places open late night on New Years. Christmas Eve as well, but that date for Chinese is big for Jews since that’s the only place they can order food while everyone else is celebrating Christmas. 
Chinese New Year Side Dishes. Even some vegetable dishes are iconic Chinese New Year foods. Buddha’s Delight, consisting of at least 8 ingredients, is often eaten the morning of Chinese New Year after a ceremonial offering of food to honor family ancestors. 
Marinate the Beef: In a bowl, combine the beef slices with soy sauce, hoisin sauce, and Shaoxing wine. Let it marinate for 20 minutes. Prepare the Noodles: Cook the Chinese wheat noodles according to the package instructions.
