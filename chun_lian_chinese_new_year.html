        <p>Spring Festival Couplets, Chunlian in Chinese, is also known as Spring Couplets or Chinese New Year Couplets. It is the most common and important custom when celebrating Chinese New Year. This tradition is widely kept both in modern cities and rural areas of China. 
Spring Festival couplets or Chinese New Year couplets, also known as Chunlian 春联|春聯 (chūn lián) in Chinese, are traditional poetic verses written on red paper strips and displayed on and beside the front doors of homes during the Chinese New Year, also known as the Spring Festival. They are an essential part of Chinese New Year  
Fai chun (traditional Chinese: 揮春; simplified Chinese: 挥春; pinyin: huīchūn) or chunlian (春聯; 春联; chūnlián) is a traditional decoration [1] that is frequently used during Chinese New Year. 
Chinese New Year is the most important traditional festival in Chinese Cultre. Among the myriad customs associated with this festive occasion, the practice of displaying New Year couplets, or "Chūn lián" in Mandarin, stands out for its blend of artistic expression and cultural significance. 
But the local Chinese people no longer write on the Fai Chun. They buy them when already printed. The couplets seen today show how social transformations influence cultures, and today, the couplets feature characters of popular characters like Snoopy, Hello Kitty, and Kanaher’s Small animals . 
Chinese Couplets are an integral part of Chinese New Year. One of the Chinese couplets are Spring Festival couplet, also known as Chunlian in Mandarin. There are two prevalent types of Spring Festival Couplets: handwriting couplets and printed ones. 
For a lot of people, spring couplets or chun lian (春联) are just words written on red paper and pasted around doors like posters. But for the Chinese, they play a very significant role in welcoming a year filled with blessings and prosperity. 
The tradition finds its roots in the Taoist ritual of hanging portraits of two big, bearded and bushy-browed men on the eve of the Lunar New Year. The peachwood charms were representations of door gods who could prevent ghosts from entering houses, according to Chinese folklore. 
The hanging of couplets, or "chun lian," is a poetic and artistic expression of hopes and wishes for the upcoming year. Significance: Conveying Good Wishes: Couplets consist of paired poetic phrases that convey well-wishes, blessings, and aspirations for the new year.
