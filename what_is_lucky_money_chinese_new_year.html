        <h2><strong>what is lucky money chinese new year good luck chinese new year traditions</strong></h2>
        <p>For Chinese New Year, use red envelopes featuring Chinese characters such as福 (fú, meaning 'good luck and blessings'), 恭喜发财 (gōng xǐ fā cái, meaning 'happiness and prosperity'), and 新年快乐 (Xīn Nián kuàilè, meaning 'happy New Year'). 
The customary Lunar New Year gift of lucky money – handed out in distinctive red envelopes – is delightful for recipients but can be an etiquette nightmare for givers. Who gives? How much do you give? When do you give it? 
Chinese new year red envelopes, aka hongbao, are lucky money wrapped in red packet given to kids and elders during Chinese New Year, or given on weddings and birthday parties. 
At Lunar New Year, it’s tradition to give the gift of a bright, beautiful red envelope (known as 紅包, hóngbāo) to your friends and family. But not just any old envelope. These are filled 
First, why is the money gifted in red envelopes considered "lucky"? This traces back centuries to the myths and folklore around Chinese New Year traditions. The story goes that a mythical beast named Nian would arrive at villages to wreak havoc on New Year‘s Eve. 
Regardless what term you use, 红包 (hóng bāo) are great because they contain money. The money in red envelopes is also known as 压岁钱 (yā suì qián), literally meaning “money to anchor the year (s).” It is also known as “lucky money” or “New Year’s money.” A lot of thought is put into these red pockets. 
Red envelopes containing cash, known as hongbao in Mandarin and laisee in Cantonese, are gifts presented at social and family gatherings such as weddings or holidays such as Chinese New Year; they are also gifted to guests as a gesture of hospitality. The red color of the envelope symbolizes good luck and wards off evil spirits. [2] . 
In China, we call lucky money "hongbao" (红包 | 紅包 hóng bāo) in Mandarin or "lilai see" (利是 lai6 si6) in Cantonese . We also call it "ya sui qian," (压岁钱 | 壓歲錢 yā suì qián) in Chinese New Year, which translates to "lucky money" or "New Year's money". 
A red envelope (red packet or red pocket), lucky money, hong bao in Mandarin, or lai see in Cantonese, is commonly used as a monetary gift during holidays or special occasions in China, especially during the Chinese New Year. 
In China, it is a tradition to give red envelops during the Chinese New Year. The red envelop is also called red packet or lucky money. It is the money wrapped with red paper and given to kids by the elder during the Chinese New Year. 
4. Ensure the lucky money is crisp and new. When giving money ensure it is crisp and new. People across China will spend the weeks preceding Chinese New Year withdrawing crisp notes from the bank. It is considered a sign of disrespect to give old or torn notes. 5. Always start by presenting a gift to the oldest (or most senior) member. 
A feng shui favorite, money plant (Crassula ovata) has been touted as a “money magnet.” Not just a lucky plant for Chinese New Year, this low-maintenance succulent is also used for welcoming luck in new homes. 
Chinese lucky money is money that is traditionally given in red packages to young people during Chinese New Year. These red envelopes are called Hung Bao, and they are usually decorated with symbols of wealth and luck. The amount of lucky money contained in the packages depends on the finances of the giver, the occasion, and the age of the
