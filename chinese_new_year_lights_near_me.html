China Lights is an event that celebrates the art, skill, and beauty of traditional Chinese lantern festivals that have been celebrated across Asia for the last 400 years.

Most traditional Chinese lantern festivals are celebrated on the 15th day of the first month in the lunar calendar, marking the last day of the lunar New Year. This tradition dates back 2000 years. In ancient times, lanterns were fairly simple and only the emperor and noblemen had large, ornate ones.

The seventh day of the Lunar New Year (February 4, 2025) is said to be when the Chinese mother goddess, Nuwa, created humanity. Thus, it’s called renri/jan jat (the people’s birthday). 
The Basics. The Lantern Festival celebration dates back some 2,000 years to lanterns hung in Buddhist temples by monks during the Han Dynasty. By imperial decree, temples, homes and palaces across China adopted the practice of hanging brightly-lit lanterns on the 15th night of the year’s 1st lunar month. 
New this holiday season at the Garden, more than 50 larger-than-life Chinese lantern installations come to life in stunning displays that showcase the beauty of nature and celebrate the promise of the Lunar New Year in a spectacular way. 
The tradition of Lantern Festivals began during the Han Dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE) as a way to celebrate the end of the Chinese New Year. During this time, people would light lanterns and hang them outside their homes to ward off evil spirits. Over time, the festival evolved into a celebration of the first full moon of the lunar year.
