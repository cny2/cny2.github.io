Petaling Street – Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia Petaling Street, also known as Kuala Lumpur’s Chinatown, is a popular spot for food and shopping, and during Chinese New Year, it becomes a must-visit market area. The street is filled with lively vendors selling everything from fresh fruit and Chinese herbs to clothing and souvenirs. 
Many people will visit Petaling Street to get ‘bakwa’ (dried meat) and also Chinese New Year decorations. Some will come to visit some of the popular food. This year, Petaling Street Chinatown KL is empty due to MCO (movement control order) due to the COVID-19.
