        <p>The Lunar New Year, also known as Chinese New Year is usually celebrated between late January and February, during the first new moon. This year, it will be on Wednesday, January 2025. But if you’re in Japan, you may be wondering, “Does Japan celebrate Chinese New Year?” Here’s what you should know. Does Japan Celebrate Chinese New Year? 
Wondering if Japan joins in on the Chinese New Year festivities? The short answer is no—Japan doesn’t officially celebrate Chinese New Year. Instead, the country follows the Gregorian calendar for its own New Year traditions, called shōgatsu, which kicks off on January 1st. That said, Lunar New Year isn’t entirely absent in Japan! 
As with most festivals, there are certain foods to be enjoyed at this time of year, in particular Chinese cakes, but also Japan being Japan, other sweets are enjoyed during Lunar New Year. Japanese patisseries and bakeries will celebrate the New Year with wagashi (traditional Japanese sweets ) fashioned in the shape of the Chinese zodiac animal  
If you want to celebrate the year of the snake in Japan, there are few better places to visit than Yokohama Chinatown, which has observed Chinese Spring Festival traditions since 1986. 
How the zodiac is used during Lunar New Year in Japan You may be familiar with the Western zodiac used in astrology that is segmented into 12-month cycles and associated with the stars and planets. For example, a person born between March 21st and April 19th is an “Aries” and a person born between September 23rd and October 22nd is a  
Chinese New Year is an annual festival originated in China and Chinese communities around the world celebrate the beginning of a new year based on the traditional Chinese calendar. The Chinese New Year starts on the new moon which appears sometime between January 21 and February 20. In 2024, it’s from February 10 to 17! During the Chinese New

While the Lunar New Year is not a national holiday in Japan — much like Christmas in Japan, you might be surprised to learn! — there are festivals in certain parts of the country. These events are mostly run and attended by those of Chinese descent, but Japanese residents and foreign travelers alike can’t help but get wrapped up in this  
The second New Year is on the first day of the Lunar New Year, in line with the rest of the world. These celebrations are on a smaller scale but also incorporate elements of indigenous and Chinese culture. Lastly, the third and final New Year’s celebration takes place on the 16th day of the Lunar New Year, or Jūrukunichi in Okinawan. 
December 31 to January 3: New Year’s Holidays. Japanese families prepare for the New Year with traditional meals, games, and gifts. When it comes, they pray for good fortune for the year ahead.

I was planning on going to DisneySea next year Feb 10 but when I was checking I noticed that it's the same day as Chinese New Year. Should I be worried about big crowds? I've heard I should avoid popular tourist destinations during their holidays though I'm not sure Japanese people celebrate Chinese New Year. 
Food: Japan is known for its delicious cuisine, and skiing during Chinese New Year means you can enjoy traditional Japanese New Year dishes like ozoni and mochi. Fantastic Ski Resorts Japan has some of the best ski resorts in the world, and they’re not just limited to the northern island of Hokkaido. 
While it may seem like every small business in Taipei is closed, most of the large department stores remain open during Chinese New Year. For example, SOGO usually has reduced hours on New Year’s Eve (around 11:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.), and then business as usual from New Year’s Day on. 
On the 2nd, many shops will open again and be selling lucky bags. If traveling on the Shinkansen over this week, be sure to get seat reservations ASAP.

Visiting Japan during New Year (shogatsu) can be rewarding, as you have the opportunity to experience Japan's most important holiday, but it can also be frustrating, as many tourist attractions, shops and restaurants are closed, and getting around can be inconvenient. 
Hi! I am going to Japan this New Years and I was in Tokyo previously on New Years. In terms of shops and cafes open, it really just depends on the shop (and where it is located) and the cafe? So as an example, the Kirby Cafe had reservations on 1/1 onwards but snagging that reservation for 1/1 or 1/2 was really really hard. 
This year, Chinese New Year begins on Wednesday, January 29. Those who celebrate will be entering the year of the snake. Just like with any holiday, traditions abound for Chinese New Year. 
Travel in Japan at New Year: Things to Know Transport in Japan. Expect the bullet train to be particularly busy during the New Year period. Japanese tend to migrate back to their hometowns from the big cities between Dec 28th and Jan 3rd. The expressways also see increased traffic out of Tokyo before the New Year, then a return influx after. 
No problem. Chinese new year (Kyu shogatsu/Lunar New Year) is not big event at all in Japan.. Edited: 13 years ago 
Yes! Given my 20+ years of experience in Beijing, I could give you some guidance for this city. Across the entire year, Chinese New Year is probably the only time you need to worry about the speed limit during rush hour. The reason is that a lot of Beijing residents have connections in other towns or countryside. </p>
