        <p>Nian Gao Recipe Instructions. Prepare two 8-inch round baking pans by brushing the insides with vegetable oil.. Add 2 cups of water and the ginger to a medium-sized pot, bring it a boil, then let it simmer for 10 minutes over low to medium heat with the lid covered. 
Why is Gau eaten during Chinese New Year? Gau, or nian gao (年糕), is symbolic of prosperity and advancement. The word “gao” sounds like “high” or “higher” in Chinese, so eating gau is believed to bring upward mobility in life, career, and finances. How do you store Gau? You can keep gau out at room temperature for 1-2 days. 
In a small saucepan, melt 250g cane sugar, 60g brown sugar in pieces in 1½ cup of cold water slowly over medium heat. Pro Tip #1 – To Speed Up the Process: break down the sugar pieces once the water starts to warm. 
Pan Frying Nian Gao: The best way to enjoy the nian gao is to pan fry it. Once the nian gao hardens overnight, it is easier to slice. Cut the cake into 1/4 to 1/2-inch thick slices. Pan fry the nian gao in a nonstick pan over medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes, flipping halfway. The sides of the cake should brown and blister.

Steamer VS instant pot method: As I remembered, my uncles and aunts made sweet nian gao for Chinese New Year. They used their hands to mix the glutinous rice flour and sugar into a paste-like texture and pour them into a container with banana leaves, then steaming them over the stove for 1-1.5 hours depending on how deep the pan you use. 
While nian gao directly translates to "sticky cake" the name also holds symbolic meaning. The name also symbolizes growth and progression in the new year. "Nian" also means year and "gao" means high, tall, or expensive. Together these come together to symbolize a year with increases in prosperity and a better year.
