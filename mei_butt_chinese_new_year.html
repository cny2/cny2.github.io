        <p>The Lunar New Year begins on Jan. 29, with celebrations lasting weeks to ring in the year of the wood snake. It’s a time to reflect on the past year and set intentions for the year ahead. But for chefs Irene Li, of Mei Mei Dumplings, and Tracy Chang, of Pagu, it’s all about the food.

In 2024, during the Year of the Dragon, China witnessed a 5.7% year-on-year increase in births, with South Korea seeing a 3% rise. These spikes are noteworthy, considering both nations are grappling with declining birth rates. 
Each Chinese lunar year has a Chinese zodiac sign animal. The Chinese zodiac year's stsarting date is a little different from the Gregorian year. It starts from Chinese New Year.

For Top Chef champion Mei Lin, these dishes evoke vivid memories of childhood celebrations. Mei Lin was born in Guangdong, China, but grew up in Dearborn, Michigan, where her parents owned and operated a Chinese restaurant. She remembers celebrating Lunar New Year for a full week at home every year as a kid. 
The only thing I saw wrong in the original skin was the fact that Mei's butt had the horizontal appearance of a table and that hasn't even been fixed. I haven't seen anyone talk about this and it really isn't a big issue; but it is odd that Blizzard would appeal to a minority in or community over such an asinine "problem"?

Chinese New Year is the most important celebration for Chinese people all over the world. Also known as the Lunar New Year as it is based on the lunar calendar as opposed to the Gregorian calendar, Chinese New Year starts with the new moon on the first day of the new year and ends on the full moon, 15 days later, with the celebration of the Lantern Festival (or Chap Goh Mei).

The legal holiday is seven days long, from the Lunar New Year's Eve to the sixth day of the first lunar month. Some companies and public institutions enjoy a longer holiday up to 10 days or more, because in common knowledge among Chinese people, the festival lasts longer, from the Lunar New Year's Eve to the 15th day of the first lunar month (Lantern Festival).

Why didn’t Mei get a legendary skin for this event, you know, the Lunar New Year, the Chinese New year, the ONLY Chinese Hero? The one person who, understandably, would be the center focus of the event. But Mercy, the Swiss
