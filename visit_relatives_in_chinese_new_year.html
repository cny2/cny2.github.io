        <p>As the dawn of Chinese New Year approaches, bustling streets come alive with vibrant decorations and the heady scent of anticipation fills the air. Amidst the joyful chaos, one tradition stands out as a cornerstone of the holiday: visiting relatives. But why do people embark on this annual pilgrimage to reconnect with loved ones during this auspicious time? 
A special way for people to express good wishes to each other and an important Chinese New Year tradition is to visit relatives. Generally speaking, people drop in at relatives and friends' houses, bringing gifts or red envelopes, and greeting one another with 'Happy New Year'.

9. Visiting Family and Friends. Chinese New Year is a time for family reunions. People make an effort to visit the homes of relatives and close friends to exchange greetings and well-wishes. This practice fosters a sense of unity and strengthens social bonds. 
Chinese New Year celebration is not exclusive to immediate family members, but among all relatives and friends. Married couples should visit the wife’s parents on the second day of the New Year.
