        <h2><strong>chinese new year christian sermon lego chinese new year 2025 vip</strong></h2>
        <p>Chinese New Year (CNY), also known as the Lunar New Year or the Spring Festival, is the most important of the traditional Chinese holidays. The date of Chinese New Year is determined by the Chinese calendar, based on a combination of lunar and solar movements. This is why CNY falls on a different date each year. This year, it falls on 12 Feb 2021. 
Our Christian witness also includes being careful about our participation in the “vices” of Chinese New Year (gambling, excessive drinking, gluttony and revelry). Bearing in mind that our bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19), we should honour God by turning away from anything that infringes on biblical standards. 
Because of the dating, the beginning of the year can fall anywhere between late January and the middle of February. Chinese New Year fell on February 3, last Thursday. But traditionally the celebration goes on for several days. So it is perfectly proper for us to have this banquet on the fourth day of Chinese New Year. 
The Bible describes the born-again Christian as the new self that looks like the humanity that God has always intended (Pic Ref: twimg) The start of a new year often connotes the renewal of things. This is no different for Chinese New Year. Family relationships and friendships are renewed, and the house goes through spring cleaning. 
Chinese lunar calendar. The Chinese generally have adopted the Western calendar since 1911, but the lunar calendar, based on astrology and the cycles of the moon, is still used for festive occasions such as the Chinese New Year. Astrology is one of China’s most ancient philosophies – perhaps more than 3,000 years old. 
Chinese New Year sermon January 31, 2022 by petercanisiusmichaeldavidkang (Special) Tuesday, 1 February 2022 : Lunar New Year Mass (Homily and Scripture Reflections) 
The old has gone. The new is here” (2 Cor 5:17). A new life begins when our sins are washed away and we receive the new life that Jesus gives us. Hence, the Lunar Chinese New Year should remind Christians to put away sinful habits and live the new life, a life that is holy, filled with meaning that comes from living to please our Lord Jesus  
The beginning of the lunar year has symbolised the act of starting over with renewed hopes for happiness and prosperity. It is also a time to renew ties with family and friends, through family reunion dinners and social visits. Chinese and many other Asian Christians continue to celebrate the New Year so as to maintain their ethnic identity. 
The Chinese New Year (CNY) is a widely celebrated cultural event around the world, especially in places with significant Chinese population. This festive occasion is steeped in symbolisms and traditions, such as the custom of giving red envelopes (hongbao) containing money for good luck or enjoying special foods which have auspicious meanings. 
Chinese New Year is like a picture of grace (undeserved favor) - as a child whose family celebrates Chinese New Year, one wakes up with red envelopes that contain money, has yummy goodies to eat, and only words of blessings are spoken that day. Isaiah 11:8 - In the Millennium when Jesus returns to rule on earth, it will be a beautiful world. 
In a society where Christianity often runs counter-cultural, Chinese New Year is a particularly concentrated moment of trials. In this translated article from Christian Times, the author reminds Christians of what is most important when they return home for the New Year. Bring Your Family the Gospel When You Return Home at Chinese New Year 
May God bless you richly this Chinese New Year, with good health, long-life, and a loving family. But most of all, may you know the blessing of forgiveness and a restored relationship with God as you turn to Jesus Christ as your Saviour and King. God bless you this Chinese New Year. 新年快乐！主恩满溢. 
By Asst Ps Patrick Chan YinChinese (or Lunar) New Year is this Sunday 22nd January 2023 and according to the Chinese Zodiac, it will be the first day of the Year of the Rabbit.As I was passing by the West Coast market, a big statue of the Chinese god of prosperity was erected to greet the people and I could not help but notice some of the people bowing before it, perhaps whispering a quick  
And this being the Chinese New Year season, you will be familiar - this is the year of the horse for Chinese. And the Chinese, liking to play puns on their words, came up with this new year wish for the year of the horse - ma shang , which in Chinese means either immediately or on the back of the house. 
Crafting impactful messages can feel like a challenge, but having concise and meaningful New Year sermon outlines can help you focus your ideas and deliver a message that resonates deeply with your audience. This blog post offers five carefully designed New Year sermon outlines that you can use or adapt to encourage your church community. Each  
One of my challenges as a Chinese Christian is to decide whether I am a "banana", "mango" or "durian" Christian. There are many dilemmas and landmines as we  
Look, it is the first page! And it is a beautiful one!" It is always a good quote to remember New Year. But there are other statements that came from a very reliable source that provides us guidance not just during New Year but every day in our lives. That is the Bible and its verses. The Bible offers us verses to start off the New Year. 
Brace yourselves Chinese New Year, or CNY for short, is coming soon! I’m not sure how you feel about CNY, but for me, it’s a holiday I look forward to every year because of what it means for me: family, friends, angpaos (red envelopes/packets or çº¢åŒ hongbao) and mostly family 
“I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven” (Revelation 21:1-2). When God creates that new Heaven and new earth, you will be there in the New Jerusalem – if you are a real Christian! 
Chinese New Year also seems to have influenced New Year’s festivals outside East Asia, in countries such as Iran. Across the last four thousand years Chinese New Year has picked up a series of legends and traditions, such as “Nien,” a ferocious dragon which, the ancient Chinese believed, eats people on New Year’s Eve. </p>
