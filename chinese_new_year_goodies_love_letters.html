        <h2><strong>chinese new year goodies love letters where to go for chinese new year eve dinner</strong></h2>
        <p>3. Love Letters . Out of all the Chinese New Year goodies, the love letter is definitely one of the most poetic. Eating the heartfelt message was also seen as a sign that the lover’s words were taken to heart. The message’s edible quality ensured the absence of proof. 
Last Updated on 2023-01-29 , 4:59 pm. What’s your favourite Chinese New Year (CNY) snack? CNY goodies are one of the best parts of the festivities.. Love Letters are light, crispy and sweet. 
For this Chinese New Year, Baker’s Well has prepared an extensive variety of goodies for you to choose from. For the love letters, they offer Traditional flavored, Charcoal flavored and Hei Bee Hiam flavored. The Hei Bee Hiam Love Letters ($23) are rather unique, as they are savory unlike the common ones which are sweet. 
Our personal favorites are definitely the Kuih Kapit aka Love Letters. Today, we will be sharing the recipe to make ultra-crispy kuih kapit, also known as love letter biscuits or crispy coconut rolls, for the Chinese New Year. The recipe is gluten-free naturally and is an easy recipe to follow for all to enjoy. 
Love letters are consumed during Chinese New Year as they hold significant meaning. In the past, love letters were exchanged between lovers, and being consumable erases any hard evidence of a relationship. When they are consumed, they also signal to the lover that the contents of the letter have been “digested”. 
Love Letters are a must have for every household during Chinese New Year. Enjoy a box of these crunchy golden egg roll goodies today! Box Dimensions: 17 cm (Length) x 14 cm (Width) x 10.5 cm (Height) Weight: Approximately 400 g. Our goodies are handmade and mostly crafted for their melt-in-your-mouth texture, making them delicate. 
That is all the ingredients you need to make your own Love Letters. As time goes by, people always try to make new innovations. You can make the snacks to have different colors and tastes by adding ¼ tea spoon of coffee extract and any other extracts or food coloring to make your Love Letters looks following the modern era! But once again  
The love letter is undoubtedly one of the most poetic Chinese New Year gifts. These sentimental pastries were once frequently used by lovers to communicate messages of love, and eating the pastry would indicate that the message had been understood. People who are familiar with the process of making love letters would describe it as a labor of love.

They are often made brown coloured but have been modernized to include other colours and consist of a series of shapes that represent good wishes for the recipient.
