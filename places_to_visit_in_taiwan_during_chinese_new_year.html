        <p>The Lunar New Year 2025 in Taiwan brings good fortune for many – one of the best places to experience the Lunar New Year in Taipei is Dihua Street in the Dadaocheng District. As well as the temples being awash with red lanterns and the constant smoke and bangs of fire-crackers being set off, Dihua Street plays host to a huge Lunar New Year  
Taipei and other major cities in Taiwan can feel like ghost towns during Chinese New Year (see my newer article explaining what’s open and closed in Taipei during LNY). Public transportation still runs on holiday hours, but almost all shops, restaurants, and food stalls close. 
On New Year’s Day, you can see dragon and lion dancing at a few locations in Taipei. The best one is at Grand Hyatt Hotel (book rooms here) near Taipei 101. This usually takes places at 11 AM on Chinese New Year Day (Jan 29) and is free for the public. 
Visiting Taiwan in February can be a little complicated because it is the month when the Lunar New Year holiday usually takes place. In 2025, Lunar New Year’s Day falls on January 29 and the holiday will last from January 25 to February 2. This will not be an ideal time to visit. For the best information about this, see my guide to planning a  
Chinese New Year, also known as the Lunar New Year, is one of the most significant and vibrant celebrations in Taiwan. This festive season is marked by colorful parades, traditional performances, and a rich tapestry of cultural experiences. If you’re planning to visit Taiwan during this time, you’re in for a treat. 
2025 Lunar New Year in Taipei &amp; Taiwan. As well as the temples being awash with red lanterns and the constant smoke and bangs of fire-crackers being set off, one of the best places to visit for Lunar New Year is Dihua Street (迪化街) in southern Taipei. 
Visiting temples is a large custom during Lunar New Year. One of the biggest temples in Taipei City, Long Shan Temple was built in 1738 dedicated to Buddhist and Taoist gods. During the New Year, as the bells toil and the lantern-lighting ceremonies are being conducted, worshippers flock to the temple to pray for a good and prosperous year. 
Welcome to Taiwan, a land where ancient traditions meet modern vibrancy, especially during the Chinese New Year.This guide will take you through the heart of Taiwan’s festive celebrations, offering insights into cultural experiences, travel tips, and must-visit attractions. 
Must-See Events and Activities. During Chinese New Year, Taiwan hosts a variety of events and activities that showcase its rich cultural heritage. Here are some must-see experiences: Lantern Festival. The Lantern Festival marks the end of the New Year celebrations. 
My brother came to stay with us last Chinese New Year (or Lunar New Year, but most Taiwanese people I’ve met call it Chinese New Year). I was a little apprehensive about finding things to do during the trip as CNY presents a unique challenge for visitors in that the first few days everything tends to be closed, and then the last few days everything tends to be overwhelmingly busy. 
Part of the reason is that January is kind of a lull between Christmas/New Year’s Eve celebrations in December, and the traditional Lunar New Year holiday, which often takes place in February. In 2025, Lunar New Year will come at the end of January (Jan. 29, national holidays from Jan 27 to Feb 2). 
1/22 marks the new year. Temples will be open and quite popular as well as local businesses around the them serving visitors. Some department stores might have special events like mystery bags. This continues to 1/25 or 1/26. I won’t consider this time “not worth visiting” but you won’t see the everyday Taiwan. 
TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Chinese New Year (CNY), often referred to as the Lunar New Year, is one of the most vibrant celebrations in the world. Marked by colorful festivals, family gatherings, and spectacular traditions, it’s an incredible time to immerse yourself in a unique cultural experience. If  
Top Destinations to Experience Chinese New Year in Taiwan Taipei. Taipei, the capital city, is a hub of activity during the Chinese New Year. Visit the Longshan Temple to witness traditional rituals and enjoy the festive atmosphere at the Dihua Street Market, where you can shop for New Year goodies and souvenirs. 
Here, the holiday is very much a family-oriented time of the year, so the majority of Chinese New Year traditions tend to take place in the family home. While other communities around the world may celebrate with parades and the like, Taiwanese prefer to spend their time in the company of their family, particularly their grandparents and parents. 
Lunar New Year, the biggest holiday of the year for locals, is not a good time to visit Taiwan. The 7 to 10-day holiday usually takes place from late-January to late-February. Many things in Taipei and other major cities close at this time, hotels fill up around the country, highways have traffic jams, train tickets are hard to get, and flights  
Traveling to Taiwan during Chinese New Year can be an unforgettable experience, but it’s essential to plan ahead. Here are some practical tips to ensure a smooth and enjoyable trip: Book Accommodations Early: Hotels fill up quickly during the New Year, so it’s wise to book your stay well in advance. 
I strongly recommend visiting Taiwan during the 15th lunar day of Chinese New Year (Yuan Xiao) to enjoy the festive events and celebrations in Pingsi. Yuan Xiao is the only time of the year when lighted sky lanterns are mass released into the evening sky. 
My husband and I have been travelling around Taiwan every year for Chinese New Year (by car), and despite what people are saying, we were never really stuck in traffic jams for too long, never encountered huge crowds or had problems with everything being closed.
