        <p>Fourth Day of Chinese New Year 初四. The day to honour the Kitchen god who would return to Heaven to report on the family to the Jade Emperor, some place nian2 gao1 (New Year Sticky Cake) as offerings to appease the Kitchen god who then either can’t speak much due to the stickiness of the sweet cake or speaks sweet nothings about the family. 
The 15th day of the Chinese New Year is the Lantern Festival (元宵节 yuán xiāo jié). It traditionally marks the end of the Chinese New Year celebration. On this day, popular activities include lighting up lanterns, guessing lantern riddles, eating yuan xiao (a kind of rice ball), and enjoying time with families or lovers. 
But Chinese people typically view the entire 15 days following 除夕 (chú xī) as the New Year Festival, and so the celebratory activities continuously span from 除夕 (chú xī) all the way to 正月十五 (zhēng yuè shí wǔ) - the 15th day of the first lunar month. 
People will prepare the food for all the days from the starting of Chinese New Year on the 1st day of the 1st lunar month to the Lantern Festival on the 15th day, for in old times, nothing could be bought during that period.

Day 9 of lunar new year is the birthday of the Jade Emperor according to folks' custom, so large scale celebration is being held to thank the gods. On this day, people will pray to "天公" for the new year to be more prosperous and good fortune. 10: Day 10 is believed to be the birthday of the stone.
