With the opening facing down, place the mold over a baking sheet. Press the handle to shape the cake. Then lift the mold and press again to release the cake. 🛎 NOTE: If your mooncake mold makes 100g mooncakes, double the dough and filling quantity for each cake.

Storage Options: Room Temperature: Store in an airtight container for up to five days.(Using an air-tight container keeps the mooncake skin soft and prevents the sweet filling from drying out).

Hi Holly. Homemade moon cakes need to sit for about 1-2 days to soften. Initially, the dough will bake very dry and crumbly, but if you allow the cakes to sit for about 2 days the oil from the filling soaks into the dough and softens them. 
1. CAKE FLOUR I highly recommend using cake flour instead of regular all-purpose flour as it yields tender mooncakes. You can also make your own cake flour. Here’s how: for 100 grams of cake flour, use 85 grams (3/4 cup) of all-purpose flour and 15 grams (2 Tbsp) of cornstarch 2. ALKALINE WATER (KANSUI) 
The festival is held on the 15th day of the 8th month of the Chinese lunar calendar and is celebrated with family gatherings, feasts, and an abundance of lights, lanterns, and candles. It is a celebration of the fullest and brightest moon of the year, hence the name mooncake. 
Baking the mooncakes. Before the initial bake, spritz water onto the mooncakes to prevent cracking. The mooncakes require 3 bakings. The 1st baking sets the dough. 
According to Shirley, Moon Cakes are eaten on Chinese New Years because the Chinese New Year is based on the lunar calendar (and the little treats look like the moon). They are also eaten as part of an autumn, harvest type celebration which falls on the 15th day of the 8th lunar month. There are many variations of this recipe. 
Each bite captures the essence of cultural heritage and family ties, making mooncakes a focal point of Chinese New Year celebrations. Whether filled with lotus seed paste or other delicious surprises (like chocolate!) - these round delights reflect the full moon, symbolizing hopes for a year filled with abundance and harmony.
