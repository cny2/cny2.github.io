        <p>Why does Chinese New Year fall on different dates? Rather than following the western Gregorian Calendar with 365-day years, the Chinese New Year follows a lunar calendar based the moon's 12 phases  
Lunar New Year celebrations can last up to 15 days, starting on the new moon between late January and mid-February. The exact date varies each year based on the lunar calendar. The new year begins  
Lunar New Year is a festival beyond compare. Technically it’s a week—determined by the lunar calendar but always late January to mid-February—but for many, Chunjie (Spring Festival) is more

You probably already know about Chinese New Year. Chinese New Year is a lunar new year celebration that’s similar to lunar calendars used by Tibetans, Hindus, certain Buddhist groups, and even one sect of Judaism. Lunar New Year is celebrated when the first new lunar cycle starts with a new moon. (A new moon is the absence of the moon.) 
The Influence of Chinese New Year on Other Lunar New Years Decorations for Chinese New Year Despite some differences, many Lunar New Year celebrations around the world, whether at the same time as Chinese New Year or not, still do have many striking similarities, largely due to Chinese New Year's massive worldwide influence through the ages.

Thein Zaw. Chinese artists leap from pedestals as they perform a traditional lion dance marking the Lunar New Year of the Snake in the Chinatown area of Yangon, Myanmar, Sunday, Jan. 26, 2025. 
The Vietnamese New Year celebration of Tet, short for Tet Nguyen Dan which means “festival of the first day”, is celebrated over three days as opposed to the traditional 15 of the Chinese New  
Unlike the American New Year, the Chinese New Year is celebrated continually for 15 days after New Year’s Day, when the first full moon of the year occurs. In preparation for such an extensive celebration, all houses are cleaned to sweep away bad spirits and decorated to reflect the commemoration of the new year. 
Chinese New Year Vs. American Christmas On Friday, February 16th, 2018 the next celebration of the spring festival, also known as Chinese New Year, will take place. This is the most important part of the year in China, and is comparable to our Christmas. 
China wanted to do everything Western, so it celebrated the January 1 New Year. In fact, in 1949, the Communist Party forbade the celebration of the traditional Chinese New Year. However, by the 1980s, new Chinese leaders had a change of heart and allowed the celebration of the traditional Chinese New Year. 
When is Lunar New Year? This year, Lunar New Year falls on Wednesday, Jan. 29. It ends Feb. 12. What is Lunar New Year? Lunar New Year, also widely regarded as Chinese New Year since the late 19th  
Conclusion. Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year are rich in cultural meaning and tradition. But it’s not the same. Lunar New Year encompasses celebrations of many cultures, while Chinese New Year focuses on specific Chinese traditions. 
Lunar New Year vs Chinese New Year. While many use the terms Lunar New Year and Chinese New Year interchangeably, Lunar New Year encompasses celebrations across cultures, such as Korean Seollal, Vietnamese Tết, and more. Acknowledging these differences highlights the rich diversity of this shared tradition. 
American Traditions Chinese Traditions During New Years there is a Dragon dance where men and women dressed up as a dragon and dance around. It is meant to bless the new year. There would also be traditional music played while the dragons danced. 
CHINESE NEW YEAR . Unlike the American New Year celebration, the Chinese New Year will be celebrated on February 16, 2018 and marks the beginning of a new lunar according to the traditional Chinese calendar rather than the Gregorian calendar. The yearly Chinese holiday is known as the Lunar New Year or the Spring Festival. 
Chinese new year and american new year have a few similarities but also are very different from each other, Chinese new year is a time of celebration in the chinese culture, typically families reunite, play games and eat dinner together but when the clock hits midnight they light off fireworks. 
The Chinese new year is from the American perspective, because The Chinese came to USA earlier that other Asian Group. My personal view is that you can say Chinese New Year to the other person as long as they are Chinese. Or you are a Chinese you want to wish western people a happy Chinese new year. </p>
