Chinese New Year, the grandest festival for Chinese people, is celebrated for more than half a month.According to the oldest traditions, people follow a day-by-day schedule of Chinese New Year festivities from the 23rd day of the 12th lunar month, with specific things to do on certain days.

Chinese New Year is not just one day but over 30 days of festivities and activities, which have their own calendar. The preparation begins on the first of the Lunar Calendar and the celebration lasts until the 15th of the first month. In 2025, Chinese New Year begins on January 29th and ends on February 12th with the Lantern Festival. 
Chinese New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, is a holiday that celebrates the beginning of the year on the traditional Chinese calendar.

Celebrations of Chinese New Year traditionally last for 16 days, starting from Chinese New Year's Eve to the Lantern Festival. The public holiday in 2025 is from January 28th to February 4th, lasting 8 days. 
Chinese New Year: Days 3–7 (Jan. 31–Feb. 4, 2025) From the third to the seventh day of New Year, Chinese people visit relatives and friends. On the third day, some people go to visit the tombs of their relatives, but others think being outside there on the third day is inauspicious because evil spirits roam around.

But Chinese people typically view the entire 15 days following 除夕 (chú xī) as the New Year Festival, and so the celebratory activities continuously span from 除夕 (chú xī) all the way to 正月十五 (zhēng yuè shí wǔ) - the 15th day of the first lunar month.

Lunar New Year celebrations can last up to 15 days, starting on the new moon between late January and mid-February.  Lunar New Year, or Chinese New Year, falls this year on Wednesday, Jan. 29
