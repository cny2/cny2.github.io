        <h2><strong>is it appropriate to say chinese new year chinese new year order singapore</strong></h2>
        <p>Many Chinese social media users in China saw red when bubble tea brand Chagee used the term "Lunar New Year". Read more at straitstimes.com. 
This year, the Chinese New Year 2023, will fall on Sunday, January 22nd, 2023 and end on February 5th, 2023. The Chinese New Year is celebrated for 16 days. Wait, can I still say Chinese New Year, or should I say Lunar New Year, Spring Festival, or something else? With the intention of being inclusive, what should this Holiday be called? 
Quite the opposite. The UN appears to use each term - "Chinese New Year", "Spring Festival" and "Lunar New Year" - in context where appropriate. As such, "Chinese New Year" or "Spring Festival" has been used when it was important to recognise the specific cultural aspects of celebrations in China or by Chinese diaspora. 
There’s a great debate about how to refer to “Chinese New Year” or “Lunar New Year,” because neither are quite right.

State-run news agency Xinhua, for instance, hailed the celebration of “Chinese Lunar New Year” in Myanmar, Malaysia and Japan, emphasizing the use of “Chinese red” in decorations. 
In contexts outside of China, referring to Lunar New Year as "Chinese New Year" and vice versa can come off as insensitive and offensive because it ignores other cultures, all of which have their own unique traditions, beliefs, and celebrations. 2. How each Asian country celebrates and names their New Year festival is different. 
Say “Happy New Year!” In Mandarin, they’ll say gong xi fa cai (恭喜发财), wishing you a prosperous New Year.In Cantonese, it’s gong hey fat choi.Still, if you wish someone xin nian  
Saying ‘Lunar New Year’ may be more inclusive to other parts of Asia that celebrate the occasion, but is unnecessary when the context and the people addressed are clearly Chinese. 
But the bigger issue is that almost every year, the Chinese New Year coincides with the Korean New Year (Seollal), the Vietnamese New Year (Tết) and the Tibetan New Year (Losar). Not to mention that some form of ‘Chinese’ New Year is celebrated in lots of other countries around the world by the Chinese diaspora (an estimated 50 million

The best Chinese New Year greeting in Cantonese is “sun neen fai lok” (新年快樂), which means Happy New Year. You can also say kung hei fat choi (恭喜發財) which wishes wealth, and “sun tai geen hong” (身體健康) for good health. 
How People Celebrate Lunar New Year While Lunar New Year is celebrated in many different countries, Chinese New Year celebrations specifically incorporate lots of Chinese cultural elements. It’s increasingly common for Chinese New Year to simply be referred to as Lunar New Year or Spring Festival. 
Not using proper titles is a huge red flag for Chinese media and consumers. Messaging: If you want to celebrate CNY, customize a video or a poster with your best wishes. If you are not sure whether every detail is appropriate, keep it simple and just say “Happy Chinese New Year” on your social account.
