        <h2><strong>comparison between chinese new year and eid ul fitr fairprice chinese new year</strong></h2>
        <p>Kongsi Raya, also known as Gongxi Raya, [1] is a Malaysian portmanteau, denoting the Chinese New Year and Hari Raya Aidilfitri (Eid ul-Fitr) festivals.As the timing of these festivals fluctuate due to their reliance on lunar calendars (the Chinese calendar is a lunisolar calendar while the Islamic calendar is a purely lunar calendar), they occasionally occur close to one another – every 33  
China will be celebrating “Chinese New Year”, generally known as “Spring Festival”, on 25 January 2020. It is based on the lunar calendar and usually falls between 21 January and 20 February every year. It is one of the most important and biggest festivals in traditional Chinese culture, and one of the longest holidays, lasting up to 7  
As a result, the Chinese New Year will always fall between late January and early March, but the Islamic holiday of Eid ul-Fitr circles the year every 33 years. (i.e. (i.e. 
Another difference between the two festivals is their length. Chinese New Year is a 15-day festival, while Eid-ul-Fitar is usually celebrated for three days. Finally, the two festivals have different traditions and customs. For example, on Chinese New Year, it is customary to set off fireworks and to decorate homes with red lanterns. 
The main reason why these two celebrations rarely occur at the same time is the difference in calendar systems. Chinese New Year uses the Chinese lunar calendar, while Eid al-Fitr refers to the Hijri lunar calendar. The Hijri calendar has 354 or 355 days, while the Chinese calendar usually has 354 to 384 days due to the leap month every three  
The Muslims celebrate Hari Raya Aidilfitri to celebrate the last day of the holy month of Ramadan &lt;3. The Chinese celebrate Chinese New Year as it is considered a good beginning for them. 
The Id al Fitr is celebrated by many minorities in China, including the Hui people, the Uyghur, the Kazak, the Uzbek, the Tajik, the Tatar, the Khalkhas, the Salar, the Dongxiang and the Bao'an. The Festival of Fast-breaking is usually celebrated on October 1 of the Islamic calendar in Muslim countries, but in China the Hui , Uyghu r, Salar and  
Answer: We all know that western new year begins a new civil year, based on solar calendar. And for Chinese Lunar New Year, Chinese people usually use lunisolar calendar, basically the exact date for the new year is determined by the traditional lunar calendar, which is different on the Gregorian calendar every year. 
Hence if the Eid falls in the first ten days of a Gregorian calendar year, there will be a second Eid in the last ten days of the same Gregorian calendar year, as happened in 2000 CE. The Gregorian date may vary between countries depending on the local visibility of the new moon. 
In Islam there are two Eids - Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha. The word 'Eid' means 'feast' or 'festival'. Each year Muslims celebrate both Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha - but the names often get  
This is also used on Eid ul-Fitr. To be more specific, you can say “Eid ul-Fitr Mubarak” or “Eid ul-Adha Mubarak” but given that the two holidays fall at different times of the year, “Eid Mubarak” works just fine. What is Eid ul-Fitr? Eid ul-Fitr marks the end of Ramadan and lasts for one day. 
Eid-ul-Fitr and Eid-ul-Adha:- Eid holds a significant place in the Islamic calendar, marked by two major celebrations: Eid-ul-Fitr and Eid-ul-Adha. While both festivals are observed with immense joy and fervor, they each carry distinct meanings, histories, and rituals. Understanding the differences between Eid-ul-Fitr and Eid-ul-Adha sheds light on the diverse tapestry of Islamic culture and  
Eid al-Fitr is a festival to celebrate the end of the fast. Each country and culture will celebrate the day differently, but typically it is 1-3 days long and involves celebrating with friends and family, making donations to the poor, prayer, giving gifts (especially to children), and feasting. 
Eid Ul Fitr: The eid ul fitr started with a prayer gathering. Different traditions of Eid ul Fitr are implemented in different cultures around the globe. The inter-family visits on three days of Eid ul Fitr is another adopted way to celebrate it. Eidiyah is a nice tradition mostly appreciated by the kids on eid. 
The main difference between Eid-ul-Fitr and Eid-ul-Adha are the Ramadan and the Qurbani or sacrifice of domestic animals. Otherwise the celebrations are similar in many ways. Preparation of Eid: The Joy of Eid starts long before with shopping. People buy new dresses for themselves, their families, friends and fore families. 
The climax of Eid al Fitr’s is the Eid prayer or Salat ul Eid. People gather in large groups, often in a capacious hall or a vast field, making it easy for everyone to join. This prayer, consisting of two units with additional takbirs, is unique to salat ul Eid and can be prayed—from sunrise until mid-day. 
This article aims to clarify the difference between Eid Mubarak and Eid-ul-Fitr and to explain what each phrase represents. Eid-ul-Fitr is the religious festival that concludes the holy month of Ramadan. Ramadan is the Islamic month of fasting during which Muslims abstain from all food, drinks and other physical needs between dawn and sunset. 
Eid al-Fitr 2024: The Eid celebration holds significant importance for Muslims worldwide. It serves as a reminder of the values of generosity and charity, as people exchange gifts and share meals  
These are the days of eid-ul azha and Eid-ul Fitr (Sunan Abu Daud, Quitabul Eidayan)'. It is noteworthy that the people of Madina used to observe two days, one named Nauroj that followed the full moon of autumn and the other Mihirjan that followed the full moon of spring and the celebrations included joy and delight, sports and funs of vulgar  
As we explore the vibrant world of Islamic celebrations, two major festivals stand out: Eid-ul-Fitr and Eid-al-Adha. Both are quintessential to the Muslim faith and are celebrated with great enthusiasm around the world. However, despite their shared spirit of festivity and devotion, there are significant differences between Eid-ul-Fitr and Eid-al-Adha in terms of origin, significance,  </p>
