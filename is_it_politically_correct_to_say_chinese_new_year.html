        <p>Many Chinese social media users in China saw red when bubble tea brand Chagee used the term "Lunar New Year". Read more at straitstimes.com. 
There is nothing wrong or offensive with saying Chinese New Year. However, if a person is referring to the New Year Celebrations taking place in all Asian countries or Asian communities throughout the world as “Chinese New Year” then this isn’t correct either. “Chinese New Year” should not be a blanket term used for this celebration. 
The political correctness, or incorrectness, of saying ‘Happy Lunar New Year’ World Think you are being culturally sensitive when you wish people “Happy Lunar New Year” instead of “Happy Chinese New Year”? 
The city understands that using “Lunar New Year” doesn’t diminish Chinese cultural heritage – it simply acknowledges the festival’s broader regional significance. At Causeway Bay’s Times Square, elaborate decorations celebrate “Chinese New Year” in Chinese text while English signage reads “Lunar New Year.” 
What got some Chinese especially incensed is that they see Chagee’s use of “Lunar New Year” as a betrayal by a company which, having made its fortunes in China by playing up Chinese cultural elements, chose to downplay the Chinese aspect of New Year as it courts overseas consumers on Instagram, a social media app banned in China. 
However, the usage of “Lunar New Year” has proved equally controversial for critics in China, many of whom argue that the holiday has its roots in the Chinese lunisolar calendar and 
When speaking about Chinese New Year to Chinese people or someone from a culture that doesn't traditionally celebrate a different lunar New Year, it is safe to say "Chinese New Year" or "Lunar New Year" or "Spring Festival". 
So, in the spirit of inclusivity, there’s been a move to call this day Lunar New Year (though in the spirit of scientific accuracy, it should be called Lunisolar New Year as the Chinese calendar months are based on the Moon’s cycles but the years are based on the Sun’s cycles). 
To this day, the Lunar New Year celebration is centered around removing bad luck and welcoming all that is good and prosperous. Red is considered an auspicious color to ring in the new year. In many Asian cultures, the color symbolizes good fortune and joy. 
“I love that people are becoming more inclusive because it isn’t just a holiday that is celebrated by Chinese people,” said Felicity Tse, a Chinese-Canadian who was born and raised in Scarborough. “It does relate to being ‘politically correct.’. It is something that promotes inclusivity within East Asian cultures.” 
China wanted to do everything Western, so it celebrated the January 1 New Year. In fact, in 1949, the Communist Party forbade the celebration of the traditional Chinese New Year. However, by the 1980s, new Chinese leaders had a change of heart and allowed the celebration of the traditional Chinese New Year. 
Hebrew "New Year" / Rosh Hashanah, is marked at 7th new moon of each Lunar Year. etc. Calling Chinese New Year as "lunar New Year" is clearly an exercise of mind-bending lunacy, given how many different kinds of "lunar New Years" are in the world today (and celebrated by people in the West). 
Saying ‘Lunar New Year’ may be more inclusive to other parts of Asia that celebrate the occasion, but is unnecessary when the context and the people addressed are clearly Chinese. 
Rant time: I've noticed a lot of people get all edgy this year when others say "Chinese New Year" online. They immediately respond with "It's Lunar New Year," and sometimes go off on a rant about how Chinese don't own the world. 
When someone says "Happy Chinese New Year," it does not equal to assuming the race of the person they're referring to. People can celebrate Chinese New Year from all over the world without being Chinese, so I don't understand why people are saying the term "Chinese" is insulting to the person celebrating it. 
At home, we speak Cantonese. We just call it “new years” in Cantonese. No “Chinese” no “lunar.” But growing up, all my fellow classmates like to say “Chinese New Year” around this time of the year just to be racist and make fun of me and I’ve just come to accept it since no matter where I go, that’s what everyone used to call it. 
How to Decorate for Chinese New Year | 5 Easy Ideas. We love saying hello to the New Year, every year, with some cultural celebrations. From our traditional German feasts to our Chinese New Year’s Celebration, we basically spend the first 6 weeks of the New Year celebrating as a family.

I literally stated 'there is no politically correct alternative'. I think it's pretty well understood that 'politically correct' covers not only overt racism but also overreacting to any phrase that might be misconstrued as racist by anyone looking hard enough, or trying to be racist (e.g. "the China Flu"). 
Some say Chinese New Year, and others say Lunar New Year. But, in contrast to the first two examples, did you know that Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year don’t actually mean the same thing? Reader: *gasps* Different Dates. For one, depending on the country in which it’s celebrated, the Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year can have  </p>
