        <h2><strong>is hong kong new year different than chinese new year chinese new year lantern funny</strong></h2>
        <p>27th January 2025 – (Hong Kong) The recent controversy over whether to call the upcoming spring festival “Chinese New Year” or “Lunar New Year” reflects a deeper understanding of contextual communication that the rest of the world might do well to observe. 
Lunar New Year and Chinese New Year refers to the same thing, the most important traditional festival in Hong Kong and Mainland China. It marks the beginning of the lunar calendar, typically falling in January or February, depending on the year. The choice of whether to refer to it as Lunar New Year or Chinese New Year essentially depends on  
Why does Chinese New Year fall on different dates? Rather than following the western Gregorian Calendar with 365-day years, the Chinese New Year follows a lunar calendar based the moon's 12 phases. 
The seventh day of the Lunar New Year (February 4, 2025) is said to be when the Chinese mother goddess, Nuwa, created humanity. Thus, it’s called renri/jan jat (the people’s birthday). 
Lunar New Year, also known as Chinese New Year or Spring Festival, is a major festival celebrated at the beginning of the Chinese lunisolar calendar. Thought to have originated in ancient China around 3,500 years ago, it is one of the most important holidays in Chinese culture, marking the end of winter and the beginning of the new year. 
The Lunar New Year marks the transition from one animal to another. The Year of the Dragon, which began on Feb. 10, 2024, ends on Tuesday. Wednesday begins the Year of the Snake.

Chinese New Year is one of Hong Kong’s biggest festivals and is celebrated with red lanterns, lion dances, markets, prayers for good fortune and auspicious cuisines. From interactive installations to festive decorations there are plenty of celebratory events throughout the city to start the new year with joy and prosperity. 
Here are some of the legends traditions, and ancient history, associated with Chinese New Year in Hong Kong. Hongkongers love festivals. After all, this city observes everything from Easter to the Buddha’s Birthday. Chinese New Year is arguably the festival with the most cultural significance in the city. 
Chinese New Year's Day marks the beginning of the Spring Festival holiday, which is the biggest holiday in China. Hong Kong's Chinese New Year festival is world-famous. In 2025, Chinese New Year will fall on January 29th. In Hong Kong, people get three public holidays from Jan. 29th to Jan 31st. 
But somehow the atmosphere during Lunar New Year here is different, less festive.  I hope someday they will be able to experience Chinese New Year in Hong Kong, as I did those many years ago.

In Hong Kong and China, the festival is celebrated over 15 days, during which relatives and friends engage in baai nin (拜年, bai nian in Mandarin). Baai means the respectful clasp of one hand over a fist in front of your chest, and together with nin, meaning year, refers to the activity of visiting a friend or family’s home to exchange gifts and good wishes for the new year.
