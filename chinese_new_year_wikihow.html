Food is such a big part of the celebration!” Historically, the Chinese New Year celebration would last for 15 days, and certain foods would be eaten at certain days and times.

This is because the Chinese Zodiac follows the Lunar Year, which begins at a different date every year as it’s meant to land on the first new moon of the lunar calendar. The Lunar New Year usually falls between January 21-February 20, or on the second new moon following the winter solstice on December 21st. 
These years are in accordance with the lunar (not solar) calendar. As a rule of thumb, the new year is usually around February 4th. If you're born before the new year, you're technically born in the prior year. The New Year changes every year, so do more research to be certain. Some refer to the goat as the sheep or ram. 
Fill your home with colorful flowers. Flowers are a wonderful way to brighten up your home and symbolize rebirth and renewal for the new year. Purchase some fresh-cut flowers, potted plants, or even a tiny peach or orange tree, and set them around the home to give it a festive look. 
You can determine which of the 12 Chinese zodiac animal symbols you are by referencing the year you were born. The Chinese zodiac is set up using a cycle of sixty years and uses the lunar calendar as its guide. Each of the 12 animals represents a year in a 12-year cycle, a day in a 12-day cycle, and two hours in a 24-hour day. 
Each Chinese lunar year has a Chinese zodiac sign animal. The Chinese zodiac year's stsarting date is a little different from the Gregorian year. It starts from Chinese New Year. The Chinese zodiac years chart below is provided to help you find out the exact starting and ending dates of the Chinese zodiac years. (This is especially useful for  
To use the Chinese birth gender chart to determine your baby’s gender, start by calculating your lunar age by adding 1 year to your age. If you were born before February 22nd, find out if you were born before or after the Chinese new year on your birth year. If you were born before the Chinese new year, add a second year to your age. 
Consider wearing a hanfu coat if you’re attending a wedding, special party or banquet, or if you’re celebrating a big festival, like the Chinese New Year. In other styles, a large-sleeved coat called Quju Shenyi is wrapped around the body and secured with a sash tied in a bow around the waist. [7] 
Many Chinese families will plan their child's birth to coincide with certain years. Every year is represented by a different Chinese zodiac animal. Most often, people will aim for the year of the Dragon or Pig and avoid the year of the Sheep.
