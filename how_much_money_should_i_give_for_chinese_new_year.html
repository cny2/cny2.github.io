        <p>The customary Lunar New Year gift of lucky money – handed out in distinctive red envelopes – is delightful for recipients but can be an etiquette nightmare for givers. Who gives? How much do you give? When do you give it? 
Chinese New Year is a time for giving; whether in the form of the popular, traditional red packet filled with money (红包 hóngbāo); or in the form of other, material goods. But beware, even the most generous offering can be tainted if you show bad etiquette when giving a gift. Here are six simple rules of Chinese New Year gift giving etiquette. 
How Much Money Should I Put in a Red Envelope? When you're celebrating Chinese New Year among the family and friends in your neighborhood, be prepared with a fistful of red envelopes filled with money in varying amounts. 
If you are going to give a red envelope, the amount of the money should be an integer or an auspicious number like 6 and 8. Here are some examples of the appropriate amounts: CNY 200, 500, 800, 1,000, 666, and 888. Just like number 13 in some western countries, 4 is the most unwelcome number in China.

A traditional gift for children during Chinese New Year, red pockets (hong bao in Mandarin), are small red envelopes filled with lucky money. 
Parents leave a lai see and two tangerines with fresh leaves at their children’s bedside on New Year’s Eve. The amount inside is usually HK$20 and up, an amount large enough for them to buy a new toy. And during New Year’s Day, as children visit their elders, grandparents give them lai see, too. 
For those with full-time staff, the Chinese New Year hongbao is their annual bonus and a 13th-month salary is considered standard. But what about those whose full-time staff just started working for them, or those with part-time staff? 
It’s traditional to leave a red envelope with two tangerines (leaves on, of course) by a child’s bedside on New Year’s Eve. Given that Chinese New Year isn’t celebrated with material gifts, the amount is usually around $20, enough for the child to buy a toy on his or her own. 
People prefer to receive lucky money in lucky amounts. You may wonder what amount will be regarded as auspicious. In the northern region of China, the integral and even number amount are popular, such as 100, 200, 500, 800 and 1000 whereas sums such as 250, 400 or 740 should be avoided.

New Year Red Packet Traditions. Common amounts for New Year red packets usually end in even numbers, such as 20, 60, or 80, as even numbers are traditionally considered more auspicious. Giving new bills symbolizes a fresh start for the New Year. The amount given to elders should increase yearly. 
The 2025 Chinese New Year starts on Jan. 29. Nevertheless, anybody can receive one. Events like christenings, birthdays, or weddings also see ang pao distribution. 
When to Give Chinese Red Envelopes. Actually people begin giving the red envelopes in the days surrounding the Lunar New Year, especially from Spring Festival to Lantern Festival. From the first day of the new year, relatives or friends would start to pay a New Year visit during the whole 15 days. 
There is an exception to this rule though--you can give an odd number if and only if it is in ONE bill. If you were planning on giving 300, you can go to 288 or 299 because those are auspicious; but if you were planning to give 500, sorry, you gotta go up to 600. (4 is considered unlucky in Chinese.) </p>
