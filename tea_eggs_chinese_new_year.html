        <p>Tea Eggs: Culinary Treasures During Chinese New Year. On the first day of the Chinese New Year, residents in places like Feixi indulge in a unique tradition known as “eating Yuan Bao” or, in essence, savoring tea eggs. The term “Yuan Bao” refers to ancient Chinese currency, and consuming tea eggs during the New Year is colloquially  
Combine 3 cups water, tea leaves, soy sauce, black soy sauce, zest, cinnamon stick, star anise, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a large saucepan; bring to a boil. 
To prepare boiled eggs: cover the eggs in a pot with water, about 2.5cm / 1 inch above the surface of the eggs. Turn on the stove heat to high and bring it to boil with a lid on. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 1 minute. 
Marbled eggs are a common decoration at Chinese banquets. If you’re looking to add something special to celebrate the ringing in of Lunar New Year on Feb 5, this would make a nice appetizer. They really do look like marble but they’re as edible as hard-boiled eggs. Tea is the secret! Chinese New Year 
It was Chinese tea eggs, a simple and humble food that is popular in every region of China. What are tea eggs. Tea eggs, known as Cha Ye Dan/茶叶蛋 or Cha Ji Dan/茶鸡蛋 in Chinese, are hard-boiled eggs that are cracked and soaked in a marinade infused with tea, spices and soy sauce. This intensely flavored liquid not only seasons the eggs  
Instructions. Place the eggs in a large pot filled with cold water. Bring to a boil and cook over medium-high heat for 10-12 minutes. Drain the eggs and place them in a large bowl of cold water in the sink. 
1 tbsp Shaoxing wine. 2 bay leaves. 1 cinnamon stick. 2 black tea bags (I used Pu-erh tea leaves) 2 1/2 cups water. 2 tsp maple syrup (or white sugar will work fine) 
Classic Tea Eggs. We love to make a large batch of tea eggs for major Chinese holiday, especially Chinese New Year. The eggs in a pot signify golden ingots. We usually make a minimum of 36 or 48 tea eggs per batch, they get better as they soak and marinate. By day 7, the eggs are really really good, but usually you are just left with one or two  
Let the eggs cook in the boiling water for 7 minutes (it’s a good idea to set a timer). Once the timer goes off, turn off the heat, quickly scoop out the eggs, and transfer to an ice bath. 
Mix all the marinade ingredients in a small pot. Cook over medium heat until bringing to a boil. Turn to medium-low heat. Simmer for 10 minutes. 
It's Chinese New Year, but is it the Year of the Goat, Sheep, or Ram? In Vietnam, where the celebration is called Tet Festival, it's definitely the Year of the Goat. Japanese followers of the lunar zodiac have been busy sending postcards heralding the Year of the Sheep. In Hong Kong I saw mostly cute, fluffy sheep, although retailers' store windows include cheeky goats and curly-horned rams as  
In Northern China, Chinese Tea Eggs symbolize golden nuggets for the Chinese New Year feast – so if you’re lookin’ for a little more prosperity this coming year – my Mama says you’d better make this recipe! 
What are Chinese tea eggs? In Northern China you will find Tea Eggs (or Marbled Eggs) sold by street vendors and eaten as a common snack. While they are popular year-round, the are particularly traditional to eat during the Chinese New Year festivities. 
Symbolic food plays a big role in Chinese culture and, being that Chinese New Year is an important celebration, food plays a major part in the New Year festivities. Foods at the Chinese New Year table are thought to promote happiness, longevity, and other common new year themes. Tea eggs, in particular, are said to symbolize golden nuggets and  
I think tea eggs are just the thing for a busy new year. More interesting than a regular hard-boiled egg, simpler than a deviled egg, tea eggs have a little salt, a little soy, a hint of tea and a beautifully marbled look. Enjoyed by Chinese for centuries, tea eggs are great hot or cold, savored on a plate or eaten on the run. 
Marbled Chinese Tea Eggs are a traditional lucky food for Chinese New Year. Symbolizing fertility and wealth, they will be prominent on most menus. They are easy to make filling the kitchen with exotic smells of star anise, cinnamon, black tea, Chinese five spice and orange peel. 
ASIAN MARINATED EGGS. Marinated is a common way to serve eggs in Asia.Depending on the country, different spices and technique are utilized to prepare the marinate. In Japan, the eggs are marinate in cold Cha-shu pork, a special broth made for ramen, flavored with ginger, oyster sauce and sake. 
Chinese Tea eggs also known as marble eggs due to the lovely marble effect that takes place during the brining are basically Chinese street food. It is also sometimes traditionally eaten on Chinese New Year, these beautiful eggs symbolizing gold nuggets bringing prosperity.
