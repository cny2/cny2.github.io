        <p>Can we as Chinese Christians celebrate Chinese New Year, especially when there are aspects steeped in idol worship and pagan practices? Here are some points to consider while enjoying time with our loved ones. 
Unfortunately, some of our Chinese New Year celebrations focus too much on our temporal earthly life and tangible success. Chinese Christians, much as they value their culture, must seek to understand its symbolism and be careful to avoid religious elements that do not accord with Holy Scripture. 
Chinese New Year is the largest holiday of the year in China and if you are praying for China or joining some Chinese friends during the festival, there are two things that every Christian should know.

Chinese and many other Asian Christians continue to celebrate the New Year so as to maintain their ethnic identity. But while the celebration was traditionally marked by a religious ceremony in honour of Heaven and Earth, the household gods and ancestors, Chinese Christians will celebrate the event from the perspective of their faith in Christ.

At first glance, the two events seem contradictory: Lent is a time of fasting, abstinence and penance, while New Year is a time of joyful celebration.

The celebration of Lunar New Year by the Chinese focuses on peace in personal safety as well as prosperity in personal gains in life. Unfortunately, instead of acknowledging the Creator God as the universal benefactor, the hope is shifted to rely on created celestial patterns and other deified characters, as we see in the Chinese Zodiac. 
Can Christians Celebrate Chinese New Year? Have you ever considered how cultural celebrations can coexist with personal beliefs? In this engaging video, we w

Chinese New Year (also called Lunar New Year, celebrated this year on February 5) is the largest holiday for many Asian peoples in terms of scale, importance, and family traditions.

China’s Lantern Festival, or Yuan Xiao Jie, is another example. The festival began long ago as a religious observance but now is often seen simply as a new year’s celebration of traditional Chinese culture.

This week sees the arrival of Chinese New Year, the most important holiday on the Chinese calendar. Most of China will shut down for the week as people return to their ancestral homes to celebrate with family. For Chinese Christians, the holiday can often bring them mixed emotions: happiness and 
3. Celebrate it in a way that glorifies God. “Christians can eat, drink and be merry during the new year without any involvement in superstitious matters,” affirms Rev. Elijah in an article ‘Annual Debate’ on Chinese-Tradition and Christianity: Should Christians Celebrate Chinese New Year? by Elsie Hu published in China Christian Daily. 
Rediscovering the Roots of Chinese New Year. Chinese New Year celebrations are believed to have begun as long ago as the 14th century BC.
