        <h2><strong>chinese new year eve cancelled chinese new year instrumental mp3 free download</strong></h2>
        <p>The Chinese government has dropped Lunar New Year's Eve – the night on which families traditionally gather to cook and eat together – as a statutory public holiday, sparking an online outcry  
Wuhan – and several surrounding cities – are in partial lockdown. Authorities in Beijing have canceled all large-scale Lunar New Year celebrations, including traditional fairs and celebrations  
The Chinese government recently announced that starting from next year the country will grant an extra day of public holiday for Chinese New’s Year Eve, meaning that the 2025 Spring Festival holiday will last eight days — from Jan. 28 (the 29th day of the 12th lunar month) to Feb. 4 (the 7th day of the first lunar month). 
Chinese New Year Eve celebrations begin on January 28, 2025, so suppliers will begin slowing down or stopping production a week or so before. We recommend you ask your suppliers when their offices and factories will be closed throughout the holiday. Below is a rule of thumb schedule for the Chinese New Year holiday. 
An unusual quirk in the traditional Chinese calendar means the occasion Lunar New Year's Eve, also known as danian sanashi, will appear to be "skipped" over the next five years. 
In 2014, Chinese New Year's Eve was not a holiday; however, following severe backlash that year, every Chinese New Year's Eve has been a public holiday since 2015. This is why, although it is within the law not to have a holiday on Chinese New Year's Eve, most people would find this extremely unreasonable and inconsiderate. 
A central event is the family dinner at the New Year’s eve.  Tourists wait to board a train at Shanghai Hongqiao Railway Station to return home for Chinese Lunar New Year holiday in Shanghai  
Lunar New Year — which includes Chinese New Year, Seollal in Korea, Tet in Vietnam and more — begins on Jan. 29, kicking off more than two weeks of parties, customs and copious feasts. 
The legal holiday is seven days long, from the Lunar New Year's Eve to the sixth day of the first lunar month. Some companies and public institutions enjoy a longer holiday up to 10 days or more, because in common knowledge among Chinese people, the festival lasts longer, from the Lunar New Year's Eve to the 15th day of the first lunar month (Lantern Festival). 
The seventh day of the Lunar New Year (February 4, 2025) is said to be when the Chinese mother goddess, Nuwa, created humanity. Thus, it’s called renri/jan jat (the people’s birthday). 
Ripon’s New Year’s Eve celebrations have also been cancelled due to the high winds forecast, with the North Yorkshire cathedral city covered by one of the yellow warnings. 
Events at Nanjing Road, Yu Garden, the Bund, and the Bund Origin area—where last year’s stampede happened—are all cancelled on New Year’s Eve, the local Huangpu district government  
The Origins of Chinese New Year Superstitions. Many Chinese New Year superstitions have their roots in ancient folklore and legends. One of the most famous stories involves a mythical beast called Nian, which would terrorize villages on New Year’s Eve. People discovered that Nian was afraid of loud noises, fire, and the color red. 
Chinese New Year 2025—Year of the Snake. Celebrate Lunar New Year on Wednesday, January 29th, 2025.  2025, and last until New Years Eve. 11 Days. Jan 29th–Feb 8th.

The local government cancelled all New Year celebration activities on 1 January, including the New Year's marathon and Shanghai Tower light show. [13] [14] Guyi Garden, Fangta Garden and Yu Garden's Lantern Festival were also cancelled. [15] 
Jan. 22–28, 2025: New Year Shopping. Before Chinese New Year's Eve, people buy New Year's food and snacks, New Year's decorations, and New Year's clothes, fireworks, etc. Chinese New Year in China, like Christmas, is a boom time for shopping.
