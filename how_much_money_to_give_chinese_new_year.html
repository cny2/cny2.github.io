There is an exception to this rule though--you can give an odd number if and only if it is in ONE bill.

This is the first year I’m finally making good money and have been wanting to give back to my parents with presents of things I know they don’t always need but deserve after everything they’ve done for me my entire life.

How much money should I give? Always give what you are comfortable with. This is meant to be a fun tradition for children to celebrate the new year. Red envelopes are given to pass on good fortune to the younger generation. In Taiwan, it is common to give children 200 NT or $600 NT, about $7 and $20 USD respectively. </p>
