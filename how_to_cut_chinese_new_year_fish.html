Using a scissors, cut along the folded line to the centre. You will also need to cut the sealed sides. Also, on the opposite end, cut out a small diamond shape for the mouth.

💕Fish is one of the most important food during Chinese New Year Eve. It symbolizing a wish for abundance in the coming year therefore it is not unusual that 
In the north of China people also have the custom of having a plate of fish on the table during a Chinese New Year’ Eve dinner, but they are used to eating the fish. However, whether one eats it or not, having a plate of fish at a Spring Festival dinner represents people’s hope for a good life in the New Year! 
This same exact recipe and technique works with fish fillets (subtract 2-4 minutes in the steamer, depending on the cut and the type of fish). However, if you're making this in line with a traditional Chinese celebration, make sure you get a whole fish. Especially for Lunar New Year, it's important that the fish is not missing anything. 
Whole steamed fish is a traditional famous dish on the Chinese Lunar New Year and celebrations dinner menu. It's also widely known as ' Chinese New Year Fish '. Having a whole fish at the family dinner means wealth and prosperity for the coming whole year. The whole fish has to have a head and tail, and it symbolizes good fortune. 
Directions. Clean the fish (gutted, scaled, fins removed) and score 3 lines along both sides of the skin. Insert ginger slices into the score marks on both sides and season the fish with salt. 
The Noodles. The bean thread noodles and black moss only need about 10-15 minutes in warm water. Since long noodles are considered lucky, resist temptation to cut the noodles before adding them to the pan. </p>
