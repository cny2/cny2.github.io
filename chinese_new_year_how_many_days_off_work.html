How many days off for Chinese New Year in 2025?, Your company . views TS plouffle0789: Dec 13 2024, 11:52 AM, updated 2w ago  I work a 4-day on, 3-day off / 3 day  
Chinese New Year’s Day: January 29, 2025 The Lantern Festival : February 12, 2025 This public holiday results in seven days off of work for employees (as a public holiday, Chinese people will get January 28 through February 3, 2025 off), though celebrations can last for more than two weeks. 
What do Chinese people do then? After half a month's busy time with a house spring-clean and holiday shopping, the festivities kick off on the New Year's Eve, and last 15 days, until the full moon arrives with the Lantern Festival. Scroll down and let's look through the core traditions and practices of the Chinese New Year.

For Chinese New Year and National Holiday three days off are given. For the other three holidays there is only one day off. In addition the Chinese government practices a very unique system that aims to create longer consecutive holidays by exchanging work and weekend days. 
Qingming Festival- Tomb-Sweeping Day: usually on April 4, 5 or 6; Chinese Labor Day (May Day): on May 1; Dragon Boat Festival: one day in June; Mid-Autumn Festival: one day in September or October; National Day of the People’s Republic of China: on October 1, three days off; The only holidays that fall on the same date every year are New Year  
From 2008 to 2013 it was shifted back by one day to begin on Chinese New Year's Eve. In 2014, New Year's Eve became a working day again, which provoked hostile discussion by netizens and academics. [6] [7] However, since 2015, Chinese New Year's Eve is usually swapped with nearby weekends so that people need not work on Chinese New Year's Eve.

The triple pay for working on national holidays can only be granted to the original national holiday days stipulated by law, such as one day for the New Year and three days for the Chinese New Year. Employees who work during the adjusted breaks will only be granted double pay for overtime. Private companies, however, have the right to determine

Chinese New Year is thought to be one of the oldest holidays in the world and has great significance for Chinese culture. This festival, based on the lunar calendar, also called the Lunar New Year, Lantern Festival, or Spring Festival, typically marks the beginning of spring and the end of the winter solstice, and it’s celebrated in many countries in Southeast Asia. 
Chinese New Year doesn’t fall on the same day every year, because it follows the lunar calendar. According to this calendar, the new year begins on the new moon between January 21 st and February 20 th , so the exact date of the Spring Festival changes every year. 
The holiday is sometimes called the Lunar New Year because the dates of celebration follow the phases of the moon. Since the mid-1990s people in China have been given seven consecutive days off work during the Chinese New Year.
