A Little Note About Lunar New Year. In case you missed it in the title, yes, cultures that were once influenced by pre-modern China, e.g. Japan, Korea, Vietnam, China nowadays, etc. basically what you might call “East Asia” or “the Sinosphere” celebrate 2 different New Year’s -- a Western one, based on the solar calendar, and a traditional one based on the ancient Chinese lunar calendar. 
1/22 marks the new year. Temples will be open and quite popular as well as local businesses around the them serving visitors. Some department stores might have special events like mystery bags.
