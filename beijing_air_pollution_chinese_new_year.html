Abstract. Comprehensive measurements are vital to obtain big enough datasets for better understanding the complex atmosphere and further improving the air quality. To investigate the 4-year variation of air quality and the influences of special events (Beijing Winter Olympics, COVID lockdown and Chinese New Year) on it during the wintertime in polluted urban air, we conducted comprehensive  
The city's air quality usually improves over Chinese New Year, as factories close down and people stay at home and out of their cars. More on this story Beijing gets more pollution data 
&lt;p indent="0mm"&gt;Persistent air pollution in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region (BTH) has become an extremely complex challenge due to the combined effects of industrial structure, regional characteristics, weather and climate, and development. Although China’s air pollution levels have reduced significantly since the &lt;italic&gt;Airborne Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan&lt;/italic&gt; and  
ABSTRACT Concentrations of primary air pollutants are driven by emissions and weather patterns, which control their production and dispersion. The early months of the year see the celebratory use of fireworks, a week-long public holiday in China, but in 2020 overlapped in Hubei Province with lockdowns, some of &amp;gt; 70 days duration. The urban lockdowns enforced to mitigate the COVID-19  
Beijing only recorded 10 days of heavy air pollution last year, Huang said — a drop of nearly 80% since 2015. Recent photos from Beijing show clear blue skies and summer sun, once a rarity in  
Here we demonstrate the responses of primary and secondary aerosol species to the changes in anthropogenic emissions during the COVID-19 outbreak in Beijing, China along with the Chinese New Year (CNY) holiday effects on air pollution by using six-year aerosol particle composition measurements.

Burning of fireworks at the Chinese New Year (CNY) is a traditional culture in China, but it may adversely deteriorate air quality, cause fire accident and damage residential health.

The use of fireworks for public and private displays can cause brief, but extraordinarily high levels of pollution. This is found in many countries, where fireworks are associated with particular celebrations: Diwali in India (Kumar et al., 2016), Guy Fawkes, or bonfire night, in England (Pope et al., 2016), Independence Day in the United States (Seidel and Birnbaum, 2015) and New Year in many  </p>
