        <p>This is the answer. When they changed the calendar to westernize, they followed suit with the New Year. Some people are still aware of lunar new year and will even do sthg like eat a special meal on the date. For example, my family had kenchinjiru on 旧正月 (old new year). Only my MIL who cooked the meal even mentioned it was old new year. 
I was planning on going to DisneySea next year Feb 10 but when I was checking I noticed that it's the same day as Chinese New Year. Should I be worried about big crowds? I've heard I should avoid popular tourist destinations during their holidays though I'm not sure Japanese people celebrate Chinese New Year. 
That said, Japan does still follow the 12 year Chinese animal zodiac for years. They simply start celebrating the new animal around January 1 instead of on a lunar cycle date in mid-winter. They simply start celebrating the new animal around January 1 instead of on a lunar cycle date in mid-winter. 
Has Japan Ever Celebrated The Lunar New Year? There was a time when Japan did celebrate the Lunar New Year. In the sixth century CE, the Chinese lunisolar calendar became the main way of timekeeping within Japan. This lasted until the year 1873. Before this came about, Japan actually celebrated New Year’s Day along with Vietnam, Korea and China. 
The Lunar New Year, also known as Chinese New Year is usually celebrated between late January and February, during the first new moon. This year, it will be on Wednesday, January 2025. But if you’re in Japan, you may be wondering, “Does Japan celebrate Chinese New Year?” Here’s what you should know. Does Japan Celebrate Chinese New Year? 
Japan Used to Celebrate the Lunar New Year (A visit to a local temple on New Year’s Day. Image: taka1022/Shutterstock.) The Chinese lunisolar calendar was introduced to Japan in the sixth century CE, and it was the principal method of timekeeping in Japan until 1873. Prior to that, Japan shared its New Year’s Day with China, Korea, and  
The short answer is because the Japanese government does not designate the old lunisolar new year as a public holiday. Officially, China does in fact celebrate New Year's Day (元旦) on the Western (Gregorian) 1 January. In contrast, the traditional lunar new year is a public holiday named Spring Festival (春节). 
Modern-day Japan does not celebrate Lunar New Year the same way its neighbors do, but several shōgatsu traditions are similar due to their shared history. Both traditions emphasize cleaning the home before the first day of the new year to sweep away the problems of last year (called ōsōji 大掃除, or “big cleaning”). 
What is Chinese New Year. Chinese New Year is an annual festival originated in China and Chinese communities around the world celebrate the beginning of a new year based on the traditional Chinese calendar. The Chinese New Year starts on the new moon which appears sometime between January 21 and February 20. In 2024, it’s from February 10 to 17! 
Chinese New Year is not really related to the change in the actual year. Since the 20th century, Chinese people also celebrate the new year in December, they just have chinese new year in addition. Before the 20th century, they didn't use the same calendar as westerners but now they do. Almost everybody in the world observes Dec 31/Jan 1 as the  
I am Chinese American. I celebrate Chinese New Year. I say happy Chinese new year because I am Chinese and I celebrate Chinese New Year. Chinese goes with Chinese. I don’t care what you celebrate. You could be white black brown asian I don’t care. I say happy Chinese New Year because I’m Chinese and that’s that. It’s what feels right  
Be aware that you may find many things closed at that time. Museums, small restaurants and shops may be closed the week of the Chinese New Year holiday. You'll also have to deal with people going back to work when the holiday ends. You don't have to wait for months after Chinese New Year. Even 10 days afterward would probably be okay. 
I know they don't celebrate the lunar new year. The majority of the Chinese new year sayings aren't really specific for the occasion, I'm looking for equivalent of those phrases in Japanese. Not necessarily the same ones, translated, but well-wishes all the same. 
And the dating system of 30/31 day months, 12 months, 365 days a month, a leap year in February of 366 days a year every 4 years was implemented. Also the western 24 hour would be implemented and the 12 daily marks traditionally used in Japan abolished as well. And the government boasted the new calendar is only off by one day every 7000 years  
26 votes, 38 comments. true. That’s a very narrow viewpoint. It was simply New Year for all other cultures that follow and celebrate the lunar new year before it was labeled by the western world. To think that it should be called Chinese new year is a bit strange simply because.. the Americans and trade posts only knew 
The "Lunar New Year" is actually celebrated in April by Thailand and Cambodia. You can call it Korean New Year in front of Koreans, Vietnamese New Year in Vietnam, Japanese New Year in Japan, etc. Outside of the country, it should be called Chinese New Year because its where the festival originated. Or Spring Festival to be non-political and  
Korean New Year 2021 occurs on Saturday, 13th of Feb. Chinese New Year 2021 and Vietnamese New Year both occur on Friday, February 12. So, we can say that Chinese people, Korean and Vietnamese people celebrate oriental, sinitic New Year on the same day. 
At home, we speak Cantonese. We just call it “new years” in Cantonese. No “Chinese” no “lunar.” But growing up, all my fellow classmates like to say “Chinese New Year” around this time of the year just to be racist and make fun of me and I’ve just come to accept it since no matter where I go, that’s what everyone used to call it. 
We went to Kyoto for Christmas and New Years a few years ago. Christmas was ok. For New years, a lot of smaller shops and restaurants were closed. We did follow the masses who went to the local temple. It was an ok activity. Lots of food and new year activities. But it wasn’t a celebration or loud. We had a casual itinerary and wanted to just  
I see the difference between CNY and LNY more like the difference between "Merry Christmas" and "Happy Holidays" respectively. Chinese New Year (春節 aka Spring Festival) is a subset of the Lunar New Year season, which also includes Seollal (Korean), Losar (Tibetan), Tet (Vietnamese), Tsagaan Sar (Mongolian), etc. </p>
