        <p>Many shops will be closed during Chinese New Year. There are temporary stalls and markets instead. Supermarkets and fast food restaurants are open but if you’re after local food then it’s better to start your trip some 4 days before chinese new year. There is a parade and a firework show if you’re into these. 
finally making my way back after 8 yrs. UNFORTUNATELY, my timeline is super tight and my only week in Hong Kong will be between Feb 14th-21. I’ve done my research, and used the search function on the HK subreddit, BUT was not able to find this particular answer: are shops in the Golden Computer Centre open OR closed during this timeline or will they all permanently be closed. 
Hello Redditors, I’ll be visiting Hong Kong from February 8th to 12th, which coincides with Chinese New Year (CNY) this year. I hear CNY is a major holiday so most shops will be closed. 
I am sure there is a great fire works on Lunar new year 2sec day. It is 3 days to celebrate of Chinese New Year. The shopping mall might close, but there are restaurant are open and a lot activity you can do or seeing sight. the temples are pack of people, but the 1 Lunar New year, you must going to Sha-Tin to see the horse race. 
I am making advance plans for a trip to Hong Kong end of January next year. It would be a 3 day stopover before travelling on to New Zealand. We’d be departing the UK on 28th January and arriving in Hong Kong on 29th probably in the evening. I have just realised that if we stick to this plan we shall be arriving during the New Year celebrations. 
Chinese New Year is one of Hong Kong’s biggest festivals and is celebrated with red lanterns, lion dances, markets, prayers for good fortune and auspicious cuisines. From interactive installations to festive decorations there are plenty of celebratory events throughout the city to start the new year with joy and prosperity. 
Our first time in Hong Kong. We decided not to stay in the heart of Hong Kong. Instead we are considering either staying at Vignette Collection WM Hotel Hong Kong in Sai Kumg Or Auberge Discovery Bay Hong Kong SAR. We wanted a tiny bit of solitude but be able to easily get into Hong Kong for the Chinese New Year Festivities. 
The FWD Insurance Chinese New Year Cup 2025 will take place at Hong Kong Stadium for the final time on the fourth day of the Lunar New Year. This annual invitational tournament will see two star-studded teams — the World Legends and Hong Kong Legends — face off in a friendly match. 
Chinese New Year is all about family gatherings, where loved ones come together to start off the new year on the right foot. Nowadays, Hong Kong families usually celebrate with a feast at a traditional Chinese restaurant, but there’s also a growing trend of modern, creative meals that spark the imagination. 
Hello! I will be in Hong Kong over Chinese New Year from Feb 12-17. Would major attractions be closed over the Chinese New Year period? Some places I am interested in visiting would be the Heritage of Mei Ho house, Signal Hill Garden, Victoria Peak, West Kowloon Art Park, Kowloon Walled City Park, Argyle Centre, and Tai O Fishing Village. 
Hong Kong doesn't really get hit too hard by the Chinese New Year. You won't see a mass exodus of migrant workers for example and everything will be open though the crowds may be bigger and you may also pay more during that time of year. 
I saw online somewhere that on the 11th "a member of the Hong Kong government attends the Che Kung Temple at Sha Tin where Hong Kong’s luck for the year is foretold in the form of ancient Chinese poetry". That sounds interesting and I'd love to see it. Additionally I read somewhere that the fireworks display is on the 11th this year.

Struggling to decide between Taipei and Hong Kong for New Year's Eve fireworks. Hong Kong's display is probably more iconic, but I'm concerned about the challenge and cost/availability of getting good viewing spots in the crowds. On the other hand, Taipei's 101 building is also an iconic backdrop for the celebration so may have the same challenges. 
Happy New Year! I impulsively bought a ticket to go to Hong Kong for Lunar New Year and it just dawned on me that everything might be closed/ nothing will be going on. I did my research and I found that both the fireworks and parade have been cancelled today. I will only have two full days in Hong Kong(22nd-23rd). 
The lunar new year is a cultural celebration that many countries celebrate under different names, it's not something dictated or imposed by the Chinese government, so yes, it's likely that they celebrate, but you don't give gifts for it to strangers, just like you wouldn't for Gregorian new year. 
Need to remember CNY is a biggest holiday for Chinese. This is the biggest mass transit in the world for 1 week. Billions only Chinese are traveling in and out of China. Few countries recognize CNY official holiday. I believe Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia are national holidays. SE Asia thrives on Chinese tourism. 
Are you traveling alone or with others? Chinese new year usually features a 年夜饭new year eve family dinner. What’s in the dinner varies by region / family cultural background, but common things are: some kind of fish dish, Jiaozi Dumplings, and Nian Gao. A common new year snack is Tanghulu. 
If all the restrictions are eased by the end of this year, I'm planning to go to Hong Kong during the Chinese / Lunar New Year period. As far as I know there are various festivals around those days. However, I'm not sure whether the shops, malls, markets, stalls etc are open. 
4. Depart Xi’an Feb 15th, arrive in Hong Kong same day Hong Kong from Feb 15th to Feb 18th (3 nights), with 1 day trip to Macau via ferry and (potentially) a 1 day trip to Shenzhen via train A few notes: Being in Shanghai for Chinese New Year was recommended to me. Right now, the plan is to go there with my friend who lives in Shenzhen (he is  </p>
