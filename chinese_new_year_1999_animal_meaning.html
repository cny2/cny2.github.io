According to Gregorian calendar, the Earth Rabbit year is from February 16, 1999 to February 4, 2000. Those who born from January 1 to February 15 in 1999 are Earth Tiger. 
Each Chinese lunar year has a Chinese zodiac sign animal. The Chinese zodiac year's stsarting date is a little different from the Gregorian year. It starts from Chinese New Year. The Chinese zodiac years chart below is provided to help you find out the exact starting and ending dates of the Chinese zodiac years. (This is especially useful for

The Chinese New Year (Spring Festival) usually falls during 21 January and February 20, if your birthday is during this period in Gregorian date, you may belong to the zodiac sign of the last year. In the following table, the years’ starting and ending dates are clearly shown which help you determine your animal sign correctly. 
The Chinese Zodiac, or Sheng Xiao, operates on a 12-year cycle, with each year represented by a specific animal sign. 1999 marks the Year of the Rabbit (Earth Rabbit), beginning on February 16, 1999, and ending on February 4, 2000. The Rabbit is the fourth animal in the zodiac sequence and is known for its gentle and elegant nature. 
People born in the year of 1939 (Feb. 19, 1939 - Feb. 08, 1940) or 1999 (Feb. 16, 1999 - Feb. 04, 2000) which is Ji Mao Year are members of the Earth Rabbit. For those born before Feb. 19, 1939 or Feb. 16, 1999, they belong to the zodiac animal of Earth Tiger. 
The Chinese Zodiac operates on a 12-year cycle, with each year corresponding to one of twelve animals: Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Sheep (Goat), Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Pig. These animals are believed to represent certain characteristics and qualities, which are said to influence the personalities of those born in that year. 
But people born in 1999 in Chinese astrology, meaning they were born in the year of the Rabbit, teach us that the wisdom of the East has plenty to teach us about these people. While it is true that people born in 1999, the Year of the Rabbit , are disinclined towards conflict or rowdy discussions, they aren’t as shy as they sometimes are made  
Similarly, they can use their understanding and thoughtfulness to find success in business, public relations or advertising.

The date of Chinese New Year moves every year, in accordance with the moon, falling any time between January 21 and February 20.. Each year is assigned one of 12 zodiac animal signs, with the  
Although the calendar for each lunar new year starts a little later—sometime in January or February of the Gregorian calendar—the zodiac animals still roughly correspond to years in the western calendar. The year 2025, for example, is the Year of the Snake, while 2026 will be the Year of the Horse.
