        <h2><strong>is the chinese new year on the same day every year story of chinese new year twinkl</strong></h2>
        <p>Every year, the Lunar New Year marks the transition from one animal to another. The Year of the Dragon, which began on Feb. 10, 2024, ended Tuesday to begin the Year of the Snake. 
Lunar New Year starts this week, marking an important holiday in China and other Asian communities. Lunar New Year celebrations can last up to 15 days, starting on the new moon between late  
China holds 1.4 billion people (18.4 percent of the world’s total population, but who’s counting?) and every year, nearly three billion people fan across the country, returning to their hometowns. 
Chinese New Year doesn’t fall on the same day every year, because it follows the lunar calendar. According to this calendar, the new year begins on the new moon between January 21 st and February 20 th, so the exact date of the Spring Festival changes every year. 
More than 1.5 billion people celebrate the Chinese New Year every year, marking the beginning of the upcoming 12 months on the traditional lunisolar calendar.  fall on the same day every year  
The seventh day of the Lunar New Year (February 4, 2025) is said to be when the Chinese mother goddess, Nuwa, created humanity. Thus, it’s called renri/jan jat (the people’s birthday). 
Every single year, a new animal is focused on in regards to Chinese New Year celebrations. For 2022, it is the Year of the Tiger. It’s been quite some time since the tiger has gotten so much attention! The last time the world celebrated the Year of the Tiger was in 2010. 
People born in the Years of the Snake including 1929, 1941, 1953, 1965, 1977, 1989, and 2025 will experience their Zodiac Year of Birth (Ben Ming Nian). 2026 Chinese New Year falls on Feb. 17th and it is the Year of Horse. 
Because it coincides with the Gregorian calendar, it is the same date every year. The Chinese New Year coincides with the lunar calendar. On the lunar calendar, the first day of the month begins during the new moon. Because of this, the Chinese New Year falls on different dates each year. However, it does always fall between January 21 and  
The Chinese New Year celebrations in North and South Korea are known as Korean New Year. The time in Beijing is 1 hour different from the time in the Korean capital cities of Pyongyang and Seoul. About one time every 24 years, this makes the Korean New Year start on the day after the Chinese New Year. 
Are Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year the Same Thing? Simply put, Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year are not the same. Despite being related, there are a few noteworthy differences between the two. Read on to find out what they are. The Differences between Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year 1. 
The terms Lunar New Year and Chinese New Year are often used interchangeably. But it’s not the same. Although both celebrate the start of a new year according to the lunar calendar, they have different meanings, traditions, and cultural significance. 
After living in China for 3 years as V-Trust Sales Manager and 1 year in Vietnam as V-Trust Country Manager, I am happy to share my experience and feelings, even if, for sure, I don’t know everything and they may not be exhaustive. Chinese New Year and the Vietnamese New Year (called Tết in Vietnam) actually have a lot in common. 
Chinese New Year is on a different day every year because our western calendar (Gregorian) doesn't match with the Chinese Lunar Calendar. Thus, sometimes, the Chinese New Year lands in January  
Occasionally, about every 24 years, Korean New Year will occur one day after Chinese New Year because of the new moon between Korea’s midnight (15:00UTC) and China’s midnight (16:00UTC). Okay, so nearly everyone in the world has adopted the Gregorian calendar and thus celebrate new year’s day on January 1st. 
2025 Lunar New Year falls on January 29th. The public holiday lasts from January 28th to February 3rd, during which the New Year's Eve on January 28th and the New Year's Day on January 29th are the peak time of celebration. The commonly known New Year calendar counts from the New Year's Eve to the Lantern Festival on February 12th 2025. 
The fact is, the Chinese New Year — or the Lunar New Year — isn’t, strictly speaking, purely lunar. Many parts of the world celebrate the “Lunar” New Year 
'Spring Festival' refers to the same festival more commonly known in English as the 'Chinese New Year'. It is the biggest festival in China. Spring Festival 2025 falls on Wednesday, Jan 29th, 2025, beginning a year of the Snake. 
The day before Chinese New Year's Eve is also designated as holiday, but as a bridge holiday, and will be made up on an earlier or later Saturday. Additional bridge holidays may apply, resulting in 9-day or 10-day weekends. [59] [60] [61] 4 (legally), 9–10 (including Saturdays and Sundays) [62] Thailand: Wan Trut Chin (Chinese New Year's Day)
