        <h2><strong>chinese new year fish cake 2025 chinese new years day parade san francisco</strong></h2>
        <p>The auspicious symbolism of these traditional Chinese New Year foods is based on their pronunciations or appearance. Not only do the dishes themselves matter, but also the preparation, and ways of serving and eating mean a lot. The most common Chinese New Year foods include dumplings, fish, spring rolls, and niangao. We've rounded up 12  
“Shin Nian Kwai Le” is the official greeting for Happy New Year. Lunar New Year, Spring Festival, more commonly known as Chinese New Year, is the most important holiday in several Asian countries. The weeks-long celebration includes the gathering of family and friends, eating good food, and handing out red envelopes to children and retirees. 
Why Make This. Better for your wallet: Koi fish jelly is often seen during Chinese New Year in Singapore and Hong Kong.Like most Chinese desserts during CNY, the prices can be rather high. 5 medium-sized fish jellies cost S$100 from Robinsons, a mid-tier department store in Singapore, or $49.20 if you buy 1 piece from Regent Hotel (a 5-star hotel). 
Spring rolls, golden-like ingots, offer wealth, while longevity noodles represent hopes for long, healthy lives. Sweet rice balls snuggled in a warm embrace of syrup symbolize family togetherness, while Nian gao, the year cake, reaches new heights of accomplishment. Oranges, tangerines, and pomelos, spheres of sunlight, bring luck and plenty  
The word for fish in Chinese is 鱼 ( pronounced "yú"), which sounds like a word related to abundance, 余 (also pronounced "yú). Fish is served and eaten whole for the new year so as not to cut or sever the abundance it symbolizes. If you are intimidated by working with whole fish, this recipe will surprise you with its ease and approachability. 
Celebrate Chinese New Year with symbolic foods that represent luck, prosperity, and happiness. Mark the occasion with traditional dishes like fish, dumplings, whole chicken, spring rolls, Chinese New Year cake, and sweet rice balls. 
Koi fish-shaped rice cake is a traditional Chinese New Year dish and also a type of sushi in Japanese culture. Here are the steps to make Koi fish-shaped rice cake: Prepare the ingredients: glutinous rice flour, water, food coloring, sesame paste, red dates, honey dates, walnuts, raisins, etc.
