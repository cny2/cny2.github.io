A tiger cub lashed out at at rabbit during a Chinese zoo’s New Year handover. The shocked staff shouted for the animals to stop and pulled them apart before the video cut off. 
On Jan. 21, in Linfen, North #China's Shanxi Province, Linfen #Zoo held the "#tiger-#rabbit handover" ceremony. Two staff held the rabbit and tiger cubs in a

Different news media in China reported that the rabbit was ok as the zookeepers from Linfen Zoo were able to pull the tiger off the rabbit on time. On Sunday, the Year of the Tiger (2022) ended, and the Year of the Rabbit (2023) started in China, Japan and other East Asian countries. Vietnam celebrated the Year of the Cat. 
The event at the Linfen Zoo was to carry out the passing of baton from the Year of the Tiger (2022) to the Year of the Rabbit (2023) -- it made sense because the zoo had these animals in its exhibits. 
Chinese New Year (CNY) 2023 is all about the Year Of The Tiger making way for the Year Of The Rabbit. So if you run a zoo, what better way to mark the occasion than by involving the “live” animals in a promotional video? However, the idea almost turned bloody at a zoo in China when the tiger attacked the rabbit. 
Staff at Linfen Zoo in the Chinese province of Shanxi had planned a cute stunt on January 22 to celebrate the handover from the Year of the Tiger to the Year of the Rabbit. But the zoo's real-life tiger cub wasn't quite ready to let his reign end. 
A rabbit in the Linfen Zoo in China’s Shanxi Province almost ran out of luck when a tiger cub attacked it during handover ceremony for the Lunar New Year. Zookeepers decided to perform a symbolic passing of the Chinese zodiac baton with a tiger and a rabbit on Jan. 20 to welcome the Lunar New Year, as 2022 was the year of the tiger and 2023  
Keepers at Linfen Zoo in Shanxi province brought together a real-life white rabbit and a tiger cub for the Chinese New Year handover on 22nd Janaury. And while the stunt – in front of specially-invited Chinese media – went well at first it did not take long for the tiger’s true nature to take over. 
🐼 The National Zoo: The zoo's new pandas are now on display, but families will find extra fun at a Lunar New Year party on Jan. 29 (12-2pm) and the District of Panda Day on Saturday with live music, panda trivia and more. 
The rabbit was saved by staffs who stoped the tiger cub. Source. Edit: this is not a tradition of China or any Asian country. It’s just the zoo’s new idea (We even have the year of dragon, obviously we can’t bring a dragon to a ceremony right?) So nobody thought this signed a good or bad luck.

Tiger is the 3rd animal in the 12-year cycle of the animals of the Chinese zodiac, coming after the Ox and before the Rabbit. Recent years of the Tiger include 2022, 2010, 1998, 1986, 1974, 1962, and 1950, with the next Tiger year in 2034 (Year of the Wood Tiger). In Chinese astrology, the Year of the Tiger corresponds with the earthly branch  
In many cases, preconceived notions blind us from approaching situations in new ways. To challenge that idea, we put a falcon and a rabbit in the same room. You’re probably thinking, “Oh, the falcon immediately killed the rabbit,” because that’s what you’ve been taught to think. 
The Lunar New Year is general, it regroups all the countries that celebrate the new year according to the lunar calendar. And it has different names in the countries that celebrate it. For example, in China, It's called Chunjié, the Spring Festival of Chinese New Year. 
The Chinese New Year is a major celebration not just in China,  with signs including, in order, Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog and Pig. 2025's Chinese  
In terms of the relationship with the people under other animal signs, the people born in the year of the Tiger can be harmonious with the people born in the year of the Pig, Dog, Horse, Rabbit, Sheep, Rooster and the Tiger itself. The honest and nice Pig can usually help the Tiger to avoid doing things rashly and make the Tiger feel safe. </p>
