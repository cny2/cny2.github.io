        <h2><strong>how did ancient china celebrate chinese new year dunk chinese new year rabbit</strong></h2>
        <p>Since the mid-1990s people in China have been given seven consecutive days off work during the Chinese New Year. This week of relaxation has been designated Spring Festival, a term that is sometimes used to refer to the Chinese New Year in general. The origins of the Chinese New Year are steeped in legend. One legend is that thousands of years  
The origin of the Chinese New Year Festival can be traced back to about 3,500 years ago. Chinese New Year has evolved over a long period of time and its customs have undergone a long development process. A Legend of the Origin of Chinese New Year. Like all traditional festivals in China, Chinese New Year is steeped with stories and myths. 
Chinese New Year has a far-reaching history of over 3,800 years. The origin of the festival can be traced back to the worshiping activities in China’s ancient agrarian society. The date for the ceremony wasn’t fixed till the Han Dynasty (202 BC - 220 AD), when Emperor Wudi commanded to use the lunar calendar. 
Chinese New Year remains the most important holiday in China, with celebrations lasting up to 16 days. However, the way it is celebrated has changed with the times. The most notable development is the mass migration that occurs in the lead up to the holiday as people return to their hometowns for family reunions. 
Chinese New Year, also known as the Spring Festival and the Lunar New Year, is an annual 15-day festival celebrated in China, East and Southeast Asia and by Chinese communities around the world. Known for its bright colours, music, gift-giving, socialising and festivities, Chinese New Year is a widely-enjoyed staple event in the Chinese calendar. 
When is Chinese New Year? The date of the Chinese New Year is determined by the traditional Chinese calendar, a lunisolar calendar that blends solar, lunar, and other cycles. The holiday falls on the second new moon after the winter solstice on December 21. Each year the New Year in China falls on a different date than on the Gregorian calendar. 
new year market Chinese New Year Origin: 4000 Years Ago. Chinese New Year can be traced back to 4000 years ago. Since there was no written record in Ancient Times (before 2000 BC), the exact beginning year is still uncertain. Some people believe that the Chinese New Year originated in Yushun Time (虞舜时代 yú shùn shí daì). 
Chinese New Year falls on the second new moon after the winter solstice. Other Asian countries such as Korea, Japan, and Vietnam also celebrate the new year using the lunar calendar. While Buddhism and Daoism have unique customs during the New Year, Chinese New Year is far older than both religions. 
The Origins of Chinese New Year. The origins of Chinese New Year go back to the Shang Dynasty (1600–1046 BC). At that time, people would hold ceremonies to honor gods and ancestors, offering sacrifices in hopes of a good harvest and protection from evil. 
During this week businesses come to a halt and people are given the chance to travel home and celebrate the new year with their family. Chinese New Year Traditions: Although China adopted new and more modern traditions over the years, such as online shopping and a Spring Festival Gala, most traditions stem back thousands of years. 
Honoring the dead is a Chinese New Year's tradition that's kept to the word. Many Chinese people visit ancestors' graves on the day before the Chinese New Year's day, offer sacrifices to ancestors before the reunion dinner (to show that they are letting their ancestors "eat" first), and add an extra glass and place it at the dinner table on New Year's eve. 
Chinese New Year is the most important holiday in China. Tied to the Chinese lunar calendar, it begins on the new moon that appears between January 21 and February 20. The holiday was  
Emperor’s ideal: The New Year holiday officially ends with the Lantern Festival on the 15th day of the lunar new year, also called Yuán Xiāo Jíe (元宵节 lit. first night holiday), which coincides with the first full moon. Lanterns made of thin gauze were colored and shaped like animals, flowers and fruits. 
One of the main reasons Chinese New Year is celebrated is to honor ancestors and family members who have passed away. Families gather to pay their respects at ancestral gravesites and offer prayers and offerings to ensure the well-being of their deceased loved ones in the afterlife. Chinese New Year is also a time to ward off evil spirits and  
Certainly people were celebrating the New Year in China by the time of the Han Dynasty, around 200 BC. When is Chinese New Year? Chinese New Year is always the second new moon after the winter solstice (like Passover is the first full moon after the spring equinox). People did their spring cleaning and got ready to plant rice. 
The Chinese New Year, also called Spring Festival, is the most important and widely celebrated festival of all in China. It is celebrated from the 1st day of the 1st lunar month to the 15th day of the 1st lunar month. 
Celebrating a new year is not a recent development. New Year celebrations have been around for a long time — as long as 5000 years ago, during the Bronze Age in Ancient Egypt. They had a  
Families would gather together during these times and celebrate. Many of these festivals are still celebrated in China. Spring Festival (Chinese New Year) The most important festival of the year was the Spring Festival or Chinese New Year. The entire celebration lasts for 15 days. It starts with the first day of the New Year and ends with the  
The Basics. Much like the celebration of the New Year in the Western world, Chinese New Year is all about the hopeful spirit of renewal. The holiday’s traditions, symbols and rituals are all meant to wipe the slate clean and prepare for prosperity, good luck and happiness in the new year. 
That’s not the only positive representation of the slippery animal. One of China’s great legends centres around a snake. “The Legend of the White Snake is a popular ancient Chinese story about loyal love and has been performed in many operas, films, dances, New Year paintings and shadow plays,” Ji adds. </p>
