        <p>This year, Chinese New Year begins on Wednesday, January 29. Those who celebrate will be entering the year of the snake. Just like with any holiday, traditions abound for Chinese New Year. Some of

Avoid the food or food ingredients which you are allergic to. Keep poon choi at safe temperatures. Chinese New Year is a great time of year to have 'winter warmers' such as poon choi when we host large gatherings. These dishes are often prepared through bulk cooking ahead of time, due to the large number of portions required. 
The Lunar New Year marks the transition from one animal to another. The Year of the Dragon, which began on Feb. 10, 2024, ends on Tuesday. Wednesday begins the Year of the Snake. 
This year, Lunar New Year begins Jan. 29. Because the lunar calendar is based on the phases of the moon, the beginning of the year happens on a different day each year.

Let's delve into the numbers, particularly the surge in “dragon babies”. In 2024, during the Year of the Dragon, China witnessed a 5.7% year-on-year increase in births, with South Korea seeing a 3% rise. These spikes are noteworthy, considering both nations are grappling with declining birth rates. 
Chinese New Year is a beautiful holiday that celebrates wealth and prosperity in the coming year. While there are a number of lucky foods you should be eating during this time that symbolize  
Chinese New Year is a celebration filled with metaphors and superstitions aimed at ushering in as much good luck as possible. That begins at the dinner table for many Chinese families. 
Many Chinese people believe in paying off all their debts and starting the new year with a clean slate to avoid being plagued with bills or money troubles throughout the year. Don’t buy new shoes 
Niangao (Chinese New Year Cake) Niangao, the sticky rice cake , emerges as a culinary metaphor-laden with auspicious meanings. Associated with growth, progress, and the anticipation of a higher income, its name echoes the desire for “increasing prosperity year after year.” 
Chinese New Year Side Dishes. Even some vegetable dishes are iconic Chinese New Year foods. Buddha’s Delight, consisting of at least 8 ingredients, is often eaten the morning of Chinese New Year after a ceremonial offering of food to honor family ancestors. 
Young says, “It’s not a Chinese New Year party without food. Food is such a big part of the celebration!” Historically, the Chinese New Year celebration would last for 15 days, and certain foods would be eaten at certain days and times. For example, in the first five days of the new year, people ate long noodles (symbolizing long life). 
Most Americans consider January 1 the start of the new year, but many Asians and Asian-Americans don’t. Instead, they follow Lunar New Year, also referred to as Chinese New Year in the U.S., which begins on January 29, 2025. (That’s the Year of the Snake in the Chinese zodiac, BTW.) 
Lunar New Year is a celebration occurring in many countries in Asia. It is especially popular in China, where over 400 million people travel to visit family  
Informal Ways to Say Poison in Chinese. Informal language often reflects colloquial expressions and regional variations. Here are some informal ways to refer to poison in Chinese: 1. 毒药 (Dúyào): This term can be used informally to refer to poison in general, including poisonous substances or potentially harmful medications. 2. 
3 Most Popular Chinese New Year Greeting Phrases. Usually, you only have to greet people like this the first time you see them in the new Chinese calendar year, and after that, you can return to normal Chinese greetings (e.g. Nihǎo). 
Food is one of the things that the Chinese take the most pride in. And of course, a lot of care and thought is put into the menu for the most important holiday of the year. As with Chinese New Year activities and decorations, the dishes are created to give blessings for the next year. 
Green is a color associated with wealth and currency, so leafy greens like lettuce, spinach and bok choy are often served as a Chinese New Year food. During Chinese New Year, these foods are often included in stir fry, soups, spring rolls and salads. The hope is some of that promised prosperity will manifest in your new year. 6. Dumplings </p>
