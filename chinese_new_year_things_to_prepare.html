        <p>The auspicious symbolism of these traditional Chinese New Year foods is based on their pronunciations or appearance. Not only do the dishes themselves matter, but also the preparation, and ways of serving and eating mean a lot. The most common Chinese New Year foods include dumplings, fish, spring rolls, and niangao. We've rounded up 12  
Pre-Chinese New Year Preparations and Activities (Jan. 7–Feb. 12, 2025) Jan. 7, 2025: Laba Festival. Some Chinese start to celebrate and prepare for Chinese New Year as early as day 8 of the 12 th month of the lunar calendar. This is a festival called Laba ( 腊八 Làbā /laa-baa/ '12th lunar month' + '8'), in the traditional sense, which  
During Chinese New Year, people have a long list of things to do. From one week preceding the festival to the 15th day after, many Chinese New Year customs are widely observed for thousands of years. The family reunion dinner, eating dumplings, and setting off firework are the must-dos that you might know. What else interesting do the Chinese do? 
One Week Before. 1. Send off the Kitchen God. The Kitchen God is believed to look after a family’s nourishment and well-being. About a week before Chinese New Year, on the 23rd or 24th day of the 12th lunar month, the Kitchen God ascends to the heavens to report on the family’s behavior from the previous year to the Jade Emperor.

Young says, “It’s not a Chinese New Year party without food. Food is such a big part of the celebration!” Historically, the Chinese New Year celebration would last for 15 days, and certain foods would be eaten at certain days and times. For example, in the first five days of the new year, people ate long noodles (symbolizing long life). 
New clothes symbolise a clean slate and fresh start, so save new purchases for the new year and don’t be tempted to pull on that tagged shirt for a quick 7-Eleven run! Buying underwear also  
People prepare a lot of Chinese New Year specialty goods, known in Chinese as niánhuò (年货).These usually are New Year decorations, fireworks, and firecrackers, as well as gift items like large packs of dairy products, assorted snacks, fruit baskets, various grains, or Chinese wines and spirits. 
People will prepare the food for all the days from the starting of Chinese New Year on the 1st day of the 1st lunar month to the Lantern Festival on the 15th day, for in old times, nothing could be bought during that period. Also on this day, people will decorate the rooms by pasting paper-cuts on the windows.

Most Americans consider January 1 the start of the new year, but many Asians and Asian-Americans don’t. Instead, they follow Lunar New Year, also referred to as Chinese New Year in the U.S., which begins on January 29, 2025. (That’s the Year of the Snake in the Chinese zodiac, BTW.) 
Chinese New Year Side Dishes. Even some vegetable dishes are iconic Chinese New Year foods. Buddha’s Delight, consisting of at least 8 ingredients, is often eaten the morning of Chinese New Year after a ceremonial offering of food to honor family ancestors. 
The Chinese New Year (also known as the Lunar New Year) is probably the most well-known Chinese holiday and is celebrated globally by much of the Chinese and Asian diaspora and some other cultures. The festivities customarily begin on Lunar New Year's Eve (which this year falls on February 11th) and continue for the next 7 to 14 days

The new year passed days ago, but the Chinese New Year, one of the biggest Chinese festivals, is yet to come. Chinese people often spend quite a lot of time, say 16 days from Chinese New Year’s Eve to the Lantern Festival celebrating this event since Chinese New Year is a major event that marks a new start. 
DIY Chinese New Year Lanterns are a fun and festive craft that’s easy to make with simple materials like paper and red envelopes. These vibrant decorations add a traditional touch and are a great way for kids to explore creativity and culture! </p>
