        <p>Calculation of the Chinese New Year has a set of rules. However, many exceptions can make things confusing. Generally speaking, the Chinese New Year falls between January 21 and February 21. The precise date is the second new moon after the December solstice (December 21) Each year the date is pushed back by 10, 11, or even 12 days compared to  
Chinese New Year's Eve and the first 3 days of Chinese New Year; will be made up on subsequent working days if any of the 4 days fall on Saturday or Sunday. The day before Chinese New Year's Eve is also designated as holiday, but as a bridge holiday, and will be made up on an earlier or later Saturday. 
Today, Chinese workers get a week-long holiday that extends through the first half of the Chinese New Year period, and they have returned to celebrating the holiday in a big way [source: History.com]. But how are the exact dates of Chinese New Year determined each year? Read on to the next page to find out. 
Hence a lunar year consisting of 12 months will be about 12 x 29.5 = 354 days. So a lunar year is about 11 days shorter than a solar year. The second rule of thumb is therefore that most of the time Chinese New Year will fall 11 (or sometimes 10 or 12) days earlier than the previous year, but if that would take us outside of the Chinese New  
The traditional Chinese calendar, which determines the date of the Lunar New Year, is lunisolar, which means it's based on the cycle of the moon as well as on Earth's course around the sun. A month on this Chinese calendar is 28 days long, and a normal year lasts from 353 to 355 days [source: timeanddate.com]. 
Chinese New Year is the most important festival in China. In China, the Gregorian calendar is the official calendar, but Chinese New Year is calculated according to the traditional Chinese calendar. Chinese New Year Day is always the first day of the first month in the Chinese calendar, however, the date changes each year in the Gregorian calendar. 
When is Chinese New Year? The date of the Chinese New Year is determined by the traditional Chinese calendar, a lunisolar calendar that blends solar, lunar, and other cycles. The holiday falls on the second new moon after the winter solstice on December 21. Each year the New Year in China falls on a different date than on the Gregorian calendar.

Why does Chinese New Year fall on different dates? Rather than following the western Gregorian Calendar with 365-day years, the Chinese New Year follows a lunar calendar based the moon's 12 phases  
The Chinese New Year dates are determined by the Chinese lunisolar calendar, which divides the year into 24 solar terms, making up 12 lunar months. According to the Chinese calendar, the winter solstice falls in the 11 th lunar month – and in practice, Chinese New Year usually falls on the second new moon after the winter solstice. 
The legal holiday is seven days long, from the Lunar New Year's Eve to the sixth day of the first lunar month. Some companies and public institutions enjoy a longer holiday up to 10 days or more, because in common knowledge among Chinese people, the festival lasts longer, from the Lunar New Year's Eve to the 15th day of the first lunar month (Lantern Festival). 
Q: How is the date of Chinese New Year Determined? A: Its date changes each year and is determined by both the succession of lunar months and the solar year.
