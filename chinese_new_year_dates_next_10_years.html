        <p>The coming Chinese New Year is 2025-01-29, which is 2 days away.This year's animal sign is the Dragon from 2024-02-10 to 2025-01-28. 
The legal holiday is seven days long, from the Lunar New Year's Eve to the sixth day of the first lunar month. Some companies and public institutions enjoy a longer holiday up to 10 days or more, because in common knowledge among Chinese people, the festival lasts longer, from the Lunar New Year's Eve to the 15th day of the first lunar month (Lantern Festival). 
In the lunar calendar, the Chinese New Year always falls on the first day of the first month, but its date in the solar calendar changes every year. To keep the Spring Festival's date in the solar calendar relatively stable, an extra month, called a leap month , is added to the lunar calendar every 2-3 years. 
It is the Year of the Snake according to the Chinese zodiac, which features a 12-year cycle with each year represented by a specific animal. People born in the Years of the Snake including 1929, 1941, 1953, 1965, 1977, 1989, and 2025 will experience their Zodiac Year of Birth (Ben Ming Nian). 2026 Chinese New Year falls on Feb. 17th and it is

The seventh day of the Lunar New Year (February 4, 2025) is said to be when the Chinese mother goddess, Nuwa, created humanity. Thus, it’s called renri/jan jat (the people’s birthday). 
Chinese New Year 2025 ends Wednesday, Feb. 12. Why does Chinese New Year last 15 days? Chinese New Year celebrations typically last up to 16 days, but only the first seven days are considered  
Chinese New year Dates. Again, Chinese New Year dates are dictated by the Chinese lunisolar calendar, so it is celebrated on a different date in January or February each year. The following table gives you a quick glance at Chinese New Year dates for the next 12 year cycle of the Chinese zodiac (as well as recent years). 
The official published dates of the next Chinese New Year holidays have been confirmed to be from Saturday 10th February to Saturday 17th February 2024. That is 1 week. That is 1 week. In its official announcement, the Chinese government urges employers and employees to find a way to effectively start the holidays as early as Friday 9 February. 
Chinese New Year 2025 is a Year of the Snake, more specifically, Wood Snake, starting from January 29th, 2025, and lasting until February 16th, 2026.. Recent/upcoming years of the Snake are 2025, 2013, 2001, and 1989. 
Why does Chinese New Year fall on different dates? Rather than following the western Gregorian Calendar with 365-day years, the Chinese New Year follows a lunar calendar based the moon's 12 phases  
Rather than following the western Gregorian Calendar with 365-day years, the Chinese New Year follows a lunar calendar based the moon's 12 phases. Each phase cycle spans approximately 29 days with  
The Chinese New Year (Spring Festival) usually falls during 21 January and February 20, if your birthday is during this period in Gregorian date, you may belong to the zodiac sign of the last year. In the following table, the years’ starting and ending dates are clearly shown which help you determine your animal sign correctly. 
The Lunar New Year, or Spring Festival, marks the transition from one animal to the next—2024 is the year of the Dragon, which began on February 10th, 2024, and ends on February 24th, 2024. January 29th, 2025 (Chinese New Year) will signal the start of the year of the Snake. 
Every Chinese zodiac year from 1900–2031, full table and broken down by each zodiac. Find your year, animal, dates and element (metal, water, wood, fire, earth). 
To help you know your correct Feng Shui Animal Sign, below is a table with accurate dates indicating the year, the date of the start of the Chinese New Year (CNY), the CNY period (start and end dates), and the corresponding animal sign. EXAMPLE: In the year 1932 (Year of the Monkey), Chinese New Year starts on February 6, 1932. So, if a person  
You may have heard of the Chinese New Year being referred to as Lunar New Year. “Lunar” means the start of a new year as marked by the lunar calendar. The Chinese used the lunar calendar for thousands of years until they adopted the Gregorian calendar in the 20th century. Did you know: the Chinese zodiac is based on the lunar calendar. 
The first lunar day is the new moon day. Therefore, we want to show the new moon time on the Chinese New Year Day to confirm our correct calculation. If you select different timezones, you will find some of the Chinese New Year Days are different from the dates in the China timezone. That is because the dates of the new moon fall on different  
The Chinese zodiac, known as Sheng Xiao or Shu Xiang, features 12 animal signs in this order: Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Sheep, Monkey, Rooster, Dog and Pig. 2025 is the Year of the Snake according to Chinese zodiac, starting from the 2025 Chinese New Year on Jan. 29th and lasting to 2026 Lunar New Year's Eve on Feb. 16. 2026 is the Year of the Horse.
