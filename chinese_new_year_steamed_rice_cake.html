        <h2><strong>chinese new year steamed rice cake what to eat on last day of chinese new year</strong></h2>
        <p>Celebrate Lunar New Year with nian gao (年糕), a steamed rice cake made of glutinous rice flour and brown sugar. This is based on Mama Lin's recipe. I made a slight modification by adding ground ginger to the batter to give the nian gao more flavor. My favorite way of enjoying this cake is slicing it into thin pieces and pan frying them in oil. 
Nian Gao Recipe Instructions. Prepare two 8-inch round baking pans by brushing the insides with vegetable oil.. Add 2 cups of water and the ginger to a medium-sized pot, bring it a boil, then let it simmer for 10 minutes over low to medium heat with the lid covered. 
Instructions: 1. Make red bean paste.Cook red beans (in the Instant Pot or stovetop) until soft and creamy. Transfer to a food processor and pulse until pureed. 
Nian Gao (年糕), also called “Nin Go” in Cantonese, is known worldwide as Chinese New Year Rice Cake. Traditionally, it comprises key ingredients like glutinous rice flour, regular rice flour, and brown sugar. They are mixed together and steamed to form a round, sticky and gooey cake with a caramel-like sweetness. 
We enjoy eating nian gao (年糕), or sticky rice cake, primarily because it holds deep cultural significance, especially during Chinese New Year. The word “nian” (年) means “year,” and “gao” (糕) sounds like “tall” or “high” (高), symbolizing growth, progress, and the hope for a better year ahead, as well as success in  
The most popular type of rice cake is made with glutinous rice flour and brown sugar. They are often steamed with red beans, dates, nuts or taro. This type of rice cake is considered traditional Chinese Nian Gao. The rice cake is steamed, sliced into pieces, dipped in beaten eggs then pan fried on both sides. 
Allergy Friendly Steamed Rice Cake. I am excited to share this particular recipe because nian gao is vegan, gluten-free, and free of the top 9 allergens, whoo-hoo!. And I was thrilled to find out that my mom’s favorite sweet rice flour by Koda Farms. is produced in a rice only facility that is free of the top 8 allergens, gluten free, and GMO free. 
Nian gao, also known as rice cake or New Year cake, is a traditional Chinese dish like turnip cake, taro cake, pineapple cake, braised mushrooms and sesame balls. It is commonly consumed during the Chinese New Year celebration. The name nian gao (年糕) is a homonym for "higher year" or "advancing year" in Chinese. 
The Chinese new year is around the corner and I plan to end the year by making a lovely steamed Nian Gao recipe. Every year, Chinese people worldwide celebrate their new year with a traditional dessert called “Nian Gao cake.” It’s a type of sticky rice cake that has been enjoyed for centuries and is said to bring good luck for the coming  
Why this recipe works. Using brown sugar slabs adds a rich caramel color to the Nian Gao.; A combination of glutinous rice flour and wheat starch steams into a rice cake with a wonderfully soft and chewy texture. 
The Lunar New Year is this Friday, January 31, 2014. One of the traditional dishes eaten during the New Year for Chinese people is a New Year Cake. It’s a very simple steamed cake, made with glutinous rice flour for a mochi-like chewy texture and sweetened with brown sugar.
