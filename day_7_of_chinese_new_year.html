        <p>Chinese people prepare lucky food in the new year, where the "seven vegetable soup" (七菜羹), "seven vegetable congee" (七菜粥) and "jidi congee" (及第粥) are specially prepared for Renri. Malaysian and Singaporean Chinese use the "seven-coloured raw fish" (七彩魚生) instead of the "seven vegetable soup". [4] 
Chinese New Year, the grandest festival for Chinese people, is celebrated for more than half a month.According to the oldest traditions, people follow a day-by-day schedule of Chinese New Year festivities from the 23rd day of the 12th lunar month, with specific things to do on certain days. 
The seventh day of the Lunar New Year (February 4, 2025) is said to be when the Chinese mother goddess, Nuwa, created humanity. Thus, it’s called renri/jan jat (the people’s birthday). 
Day 7 of Chinese Lunar New Year (年初七) is also known as Ren Ri (人日) meaning the common "birthday" of all human beings. During this day most of the family will gather everyone in the household to have a feast together in order to celebrate the occasion and at the same time do a Lo Hei Yu Sheng (捞起魚生) to bring in luck for the family. 
The legal holiday is seven days long, from the Lunar New Year's Eve to the sixth day of the first lunar month. Some companies and public institutions enjoy a longer holiday up to 10 days or more, because in common knowledge among Chinese people, the festival lasts longer, from the Lunar New Year's Eve to the 15th day of the first lunar month (Lantern Festival). 
Here is what each day means, running from New Year’s Eve on January 30 to the seventh day of the new year on February 7, and things you should make sure to do on each of these days. 
The seventh lunar day of Chinese New Year festival is the Human Day. Therefore, the Chinese Human Day is on Tuesday, February 4, 2025. According to Chinese genesis, the goddess Nu-Wa with snake body (2852-2738 B.C.) created the world. 
Laba Festival (Jan. 7, 2025): Old Chinese New Year Calendar Start. Traditionally, the start of the Chinese New Year calendar is 'The Laba Festival' (腊八节 Làbājié), which occurs about three weeks before Chinese New Year's Day and is celebrated separately. Religious activities and preparations for Lunar New Year would begin on this day. 
This is 11 days less than a tropical year – the time that the sun takes to return to the same position as observed from Earth, which is 365.25 days. That’s why the lunar calendar adds a leap month every 3 years or so, or 7 leap years every 19 years, to be precise. In a year with a leap month, the lunar calendar will have 13 months instead  
Chinese New Year: Days 3–7 (Jan. 31–Feb. 4, 2025) From the third to the seventh day of New Year, Chinese people visit relatives and friends. On the third day, some people go to visit the tombs of their relatives, but others think being outside there on the third day is inauspicious because evil spirits roam around. 
Chinese New Year's Day Gregorian Dates Activities; 30th Day of the 12th month (Chinese New Year's Eve) Jan. 28, 2025: Decorate houses, Have reunion dinners, Watch CCTV gala, Stay up late: 1st Day of the 1st month (Chinese New Year's Day) Jan. 29, 2025: Set off firecrackers, Give red envelopes, Enjoy Lion dances: Day 2: Jan. 30, 2025: Welcome

Ella Wheeler Wilcox’s poem “The Year” reflects on the cyclical nature of time, an important theme in Lunar New Year celebrations, which center the beginning of a new temporal cycle. 
San Francisco’s Chinese New Year Parade on February 15 will feature a choreographed drone light show for the first time as part of its grand finale.The display will include 500 LED-lit drones flying above the Embarcadero, forming images related to Lunar New Year traditions and the Year of the Snake.
