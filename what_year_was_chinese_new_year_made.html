While 元旦 (yuán dàn) would fall on January 1 of the Gregorian calendar, it is considered the official start of the new year. Nowadays, Chinese people will have a 7-day holiday from Chinese New Year's Eve (除夕 chú xí) to the sixth day of Chinese New Year.

In 1912, the government abolished Chinese New Year and the lunar new year and adopted the Gregorian calendar which made January 1 the official start of the new year.

When is Chinese New Year? The date of the Chinese New Year is determined by the traditional Chinese calendar, a lunisolar calendar that blends solar, lunar, and other cycles. The holiday falls on the second new moon after the winter solstice on December 21. Each year the New Year in China falls on a different date than on the Gregorian calendar

Vietnam, which was under Chinese rule for over a thousand years, celebrates Tết Nguyên Đán, which shares many customs with Chinese New Year such as ancestor worship, red envelopes, and lucky foods.
