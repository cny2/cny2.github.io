        <h2><strong>chinese new year lunar new year reddit kingston chinese new year monkey</strong></h2>
        <p>The Chinese new year is from the American perspective, because The Chinese came to USA earlier that other Asian Group. My personal view is that you can say Chinese New Year to the other person as long as they are Chinese. Or you are a Chinese you want to wish western people a happy Chinese new year. 
Let me pull out an interesting sentence for you: The Lunar New Year celebrations of the East Asian cultural sphere occur on the same date across the region, on the new moon, which occurs in late January or early February, and are based on the Chinese lunisolar calendar. 
Yeah grew up knowing it's Chinese New year and everywhere the short form is CNY. Also well known in Singapore each ethnicity gets 2 days of public holidays. Since these 2 days are given to Chinese so it's natural we have always known it as Chinese New year. All my friends from other races are wishing me Happy Chinese new year today. 
Simply put, Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year are not the same. Despite being related, there are a few noteworthy differences between the two. Read on to find out what they are. The Differences between Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year 1. "Chinese New Year" is specific while "Lunar New Year" is more general. 
In their post “Chinese New Year, not Lunar New Year”, they wrote: “I encourage everyone to not replace the name CNY with ‘Lunar New Year’.” They then provided three reasons as to why CNY is the correct term. The first: CNY is not New Year’s Day in the Lunar Calendar. 
The push for ‘Lunar New Year’ Lunar New Year marks the beginning of the lunisolar calendar, with festivities often lasting for 15 days or more. 
The Lunar New Year marks the transition from one animal to another. The Year of the Dragon, which began on Feb. 10, 2024, ends on Tuesday. Wednesday begins the Year of the Snake. 
@dejashu Don’t do this on Chinese New Year 🐍🧧 8 things not to do during Chinese New Year (according to my superstitious parents). Bring on the Lunar New Year content as the Year of the  
27th January 2025 – (Hong Kong) The recent controversy over whether to call the upcoming spring festival “Chinese New Year” or “Lunar New Year” reflects a deeper understanding of contextual communication that the rest of the world might do well to observe. 
Pre-Chinese New Year Preparations and Activities (Jan. 7–Feb. 12, 2025) Jan. 7, 2025: Laba Festival. Some Chinese start to celebrate and prepare for Chinese New Year as early as day 8 of the 12 th month of the lunar calendar. 
NewJeans Danielle apologises as she refers Lunar New Year as Chinese New Year r/kpop K-Pop (Korean popular music) is a musical genre consisting of pop, dance, electropop, hiphop, rock, R&amp;B, and electronic music originating in South Korea. 
Happy tet. Happy Chunjie. Happy seollal etc. If u and the recipient are of different culture, its best to say both. Happy korean new year and chinese new year! “Happy lunar new year” should be ok too, but now its associated with intention of not wanting to say “happy chinese new year” so some chinese people might not like hearing it. 
If one HAS to make some sort of distinction, then I think "Chinese" for the new year that falls between January 21 and February 20 makes more sense than "Lunar" because it's the specific lunar calendar that's based on the Chinese lunar calendar (the Vietnamese and Korean lunar calendar are basically based on the chinese one, the difference is  
Services are available for tourists of course, especially in big metropolis like Ho Chi Minh city, but could be suboptimal and patchy. If you like the whole special feelings leading up to Lunar New Year, stay there up until a few days before the New Year, but leave right before the first day of Tet (how they call New Year in Vietnam). 
The problem with calling Chinese New Year lunar new year is that the Chinese calendar is a lunisolar calendar not a lunar calendar. the Islamic calendar is the only major calendar that is actually a lunar calendar. furthermore, most calendars in the world are lunisolar/lunar; such as the Jewish, Indian, Persia, etc. 
When people talk about "Lunar New Year" celebrations, they're only talking about one of those calendars though. They're not saying it to be inclusive of Jewish new year celebrations (which take place around September, not January) or the Islamic new year (which this year is in July but moves around because the Islamic calendar doesn't adjust to stay in sync with the solar year). 
In Chinese lunar new year dinner, the symbolism is more important than anything else. For example, you must have a fish dish because fish is a homophone of abundance, how you cook the dish doesn’t matter. 
This was prompted by NewJeans Danielle's controversy and apology for saying 'Chinese New Year'. It just feels like a controversy that is waiting to happen every New Year, some idol will inevitably say Chinese New Year (CNY) instead of Lunar New Year (LNY) and knets will begin to dogpile them and release their sin 
The Chinese New Year also called Lunar New Year. Lunar New Year is the most important holiday for Chinese people and is equivalent to Christmas in many countries in Europe and the United States. Most people take 7-10 days off for this holiday, but many factory workers may take 15-20 days off 
26 votes, 38 comments. true. That’s a very narrow viewpoint. It was simply New Year for all other cultures that follow and celebrate the lunar new year before it was labeled by the western world. To think that it should be called Chinese new year is a bit strange simply because.. the Americans and trade posts only knew </p>
