        <p>The tourist bureau and our local office will be closed during the Tibetan Losar New Year and Chinese New Year holidays. You need to check the date in advance and leave enough time to apply for a Chinese Visa and the Tibet Travel Permit to avoid delaying your trip due to the office holidays. Generally, the Chinese New Year falls in January or  
Traditionally, the celebration of Tibetan New Year lasts 5 days starting from the penultimate day of the old year and finishing on the third day of the new year. The main activities include 1) cleaning the house , 2) eating reunion dinner , 3) exorcising ghosts , 4) offering sacrifices , 5) fetching water , 6) visiting neighbors , 7) hanging  
Lhosar vs. Chinese New Year: A Celebration of Renewal and Tradition. 2025-01-02 1 Likes 79 Views; The arrival of the Lunar New Year is a time of joy, reflection, and renewal across many parts of Asia. In both Tibet and China, the turn of the year is 
Chinese New Year's date is decided by the Chinese lunar calendar and is not the same as Tibetan New Year's date, as the Tibetan lunar calendar is calculated differently, but it isn't too dissimilar. Tibetan New Year is usually within a day or two of Chinese New Year or a month or two later, plus or minus a day or two. 
Chinese New Year and Tibetan Losar are often on different dates — based on two different lunar calendars. The Lunisolar Chinese Lunar calendar starts the new year in 2025 on January 29. (Losar — see the separate event — is almost one month later due to the strict lunar nature of the Tibetan calendar — this year on February 28, 2025) 
Tibetan New Year is celebrated according to the Lunar calendar. Although Chinese New Year is also celebrated based on the Lunar calendar, the dates are usually different. Tibetan New Year typically falls on February or March of the Gregorian calendar. Each year has an element and animal associated with it. 
Tibetan New year. 1. Tibetan New Year Is Not January 1st or Chinese New Year. Losar is set according to the lunisolar Tibetan calendar, and normally corresponds to a date in February or March of the western Gregorian calendar. It should not be confused with the Chinese New Year, sometimes known as the Spring Festival, although a few of the  
The biggest difference between the Losar and the Chinese New Year is the continuous chanting as Tibet is a religious place where almost all people have faith in Tibetan Buddhism. Tibetan people believe that evil demons exist everywhere. So, at Losar Festival, there is a very important activity for dislodging evil. 
According to the Tibetan Calendar theory, every 32 and a half months should have a leap month, so the dates of Tibetan Calendar and the Chinese New Year forming a specific "three years cycle": the New Year's day is the same dates of the two calendarS in the first year, lone day different in the second year, the third year of a month different and then start the cycle again. 
This is a “how-to” guide for Tibetan New Year, Losar, to help you celebrate the lunar new year as Tibetans do all over the world. The first day of Losar in 2025 will fall on February 28. By the Tibetan calendar, this will be the first day of the Wood Snake year of 2152. Losar-related rituals are actually divided into two quite distinct parts. 
In Tibet and parts of India with significant Tibetan Buddhist communities, Losar, which translates to the new year on the Tibetan lunisolar calendar, is celebrated around a similar timeframe as  
Losar (Tibetan: ལོ་གསར་, Wylie: lo-sar; "new year" [1]) also known as Tibetan New Year, is a festival in Tibetan Buddhism. [2] The holiday is celebrated on various dates depending on location ( Tibet , Bhutan , Nepal , India ) tradition. 
The Tibetan New Year, called Losar Festival, is often conflated with Lunar New Year. Sometimes the days coincide, but it is a very different festival based on the Tibetan calendar. 
In recent years, a growing number of tourists prefer to spend in the Chinese lunar New Year in Lhasa, capital city of Tibet. Every year since the New Year’s Eve, the hotels, big or small, are full of tourists from different corners of China. 
Lunar New Year, festival typically celebrated in China and other Asian countries that begins with the first new moon of the lunar calendar and ends on the first full moon of the lunar calendar, 15 days later. The dates of the holiday vary from year to year, beginning some time between January 21 and February 20.

Washington: On 24 January 2025, the Office of Tibet in Washington DC and IPK Media jointly organised an informal New Year gathering for Tibetans and Chinese in the Washington DC area. This gathering was joined by Representative Namgyal Choedup, IPK Media Director Wang Ruiqin, prominent Chinese democracy advocates including Guo Baosheng, Wu Chaoyang, and Luo 
The Tibetan New Year got off to an exciting start as Tibetans and world leaders celebrated around the globe and the US Congress advanced a bill to help peacefully resolve China’s occupation of Tibet. “Losar,” the Tibetan New Year, arrived on Feb. 10, 2024. It marked the start of the Year of the Wood Dragon 2151 in Tibetans’ lunar calendar. 
Chinese New Year is a major holiday in Greater China and has strongly influenced lunar new year celebrations of China’s neighbouring cultures, including the Korean New Year (seol), the Tết of Vietnam, and the Losar of Tibet. </p>
