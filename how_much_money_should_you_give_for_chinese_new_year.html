        <p>Here are six simple rules of Chinese New Year gift giving etiquette. These etiquette tips will help you give the right gift, in the right way, at the right time. 1. Select the New Year gifts in right colors. When giving a gift at Chinese New Year pay close attention to the color of the gift as well as the wrapping paper or bag in which it is  
To other children: Prepare some small red envelopes with 20 yuan or 50 yuan (or $5–10) for acquaintances' children, in case you meet them during the Chinese New Year period. To your employees: always 100–1,000 yuan (or $20-200) (always given on the last working day before the Chinese New Year holiday) Tips for Giving and Receiving a Red  
When do you give it? For anyone who has felt awkward at Chinese New Year, here’s a simple guide to navigating the social minefield of red envelopes – condensed into eight simple rules. 1.

Chinese people believe that good things should be in pairs, so the presents should not be in odd number. For example, liquor is usually given in two bottles, and cigarettes in two cartons.

So How Much Should You Really Give? Like birthday money, there are no set rules. For immediate family and close relatives, lucky money ranges anywhere from 200-1000 CNY.

Every year around this time, I always find myself checking in with others about how much to put in the envelopes. 
People prefer to receive lucky money in lucky amounts. You may wonder what amount will be regarded as auspicious. In the northern region of China, the integral and even number amount are popular, such as 100, 200, 500, 800 and 1000 whereas sums such as 250, 400 or 740 should be avoided. 
Ringing in the Chinese New Year comes with traditional gifts like ang paos (or red envelopes). These envelopes contain money, symbolizing well-wishes and good luck for the coming year. But it's not the cash inside that's actually given value. Rather, it's the envelope that takes center stage.
