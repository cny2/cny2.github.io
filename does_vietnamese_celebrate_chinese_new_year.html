        <h2><strong>does vietnamese celebrate chinese new year northern chinese new year food</strong></h2>
        <p>After living in China for 3 years as V-Trust Sales Manager and 1 year in Vietnam as V-Trust Country Manager, I am happy to share my experience and feelings, even if, for sure, I don’t know everything and they may not be exhaustive. Chinese New Year and the Vietnamese New Year (called Tết in Vietnam) actually have a lot in common. 
Rarely, the dates of Vietnamese and Chinese Lunar New Year can differ as such in 1943, when Vietnam celebrated Lunar New Year, one month after China. It takes place from the first day of the first month of the Vietnamese lunar calendar (around late January or early February) until at least the third day. 
No Tết celebration is complete without a mention of the Vietnamese zodiac. Like its Chinese counterpart, the Vietnamese zodiac is a 12-year cycle where each year is associated with an animal. However, Vietnam adds its own unique twist to this tradition. The Rabbit is replaced by the Cat, believed to bring a sense of calmness and prosperity. 
Originally, the holiday marks the first full moon of the new lunar year and the end of the Chinese New Year. In some other Asian countries such as Thailand or Laos, the festival is celebrated around late October or early November to mark the end of the Buddhist Lent &amp; the beginning of the festive season. 
Vietnamese is a tonal language and can be a challenge to learn. However, during the Tet season, locals will understand you as soon as you start with a big smile and say "chúc mừng năm mới". This means Happy New Year in Vietnamese, and sounds like "chook moong nahm moi". More about Vietnamese New Year Greetings 2024, Wishes and Images &gt;&gt;&gt; 
The Vietnamese New Year was first celebrated by the Chinese in Vietnam over 2000 years ago. At that time, Vietnam was part of Ancient China and so the Chinese New Year transcended generations to become the Vietnamese New Year. The Tet festival was originally a three-day celebration, but it has gradually expanded to last up to two weeks. 
The Lunar Year holiday was originally brought to Viet Nam by the Chinese, who were Viet Nam's traditional nemesis for almost 2,000 years. In times when the Chinese ruled Viet Nam, they also brought with them their own policies, culture, and traditions. The Lunar New Year was passed to the Vietnamese people and has stayed relatively intact  
Yet, there may be differences due to time zone offsets. For example, the Chinese Lunar New Year will be 1 hour or 1 day later than the Vietnamese Lunar New Year. Interestingly, the Vietnamese usually start Tet preparations two weeks or even a month before, creating a buzzing atmosphere at the spring entrance. 
Instead, the New Year should be called Tết in Vietnam, or simply the Lunar New Year, rather than “Chinese New Year”. 16) Vietnamese Superstitions Around the Lunar New Year. The Vietnamese New Year is a very auspicious day, and good things that happen to them on the first day of the year will set the stage for the remainder of the year. 
The Japanese and the Koreans have Lunar New Year Festivals, as do the Vietnamese. In Vietnam, Lunar New Year is called Tet. The full name is Tet Nguyen Dan. It means “feast for the first morning”. 
Tết Nguyên Đán or the Vietnamese Lunar New Year celebrates the arrival of spring and marks the beginning of a new year according to the Vietnamese lunar calendar. During Tết, Vietnamese families honor their ancestors, exchange gifts, and enjoy special foods as they look forward to a year of prosperity and good fortune. 
Lunar New Year or Tết Nguyên Đán, is Vietnam’s most significant celebration. Across Vietnam, during this time families reunite and honour their ancestors, while praying for luck, prosperity and health in the new year. The public holiday may only run for one week, but in reality, Tết celebrations last much longer. 
Happy New Year in Vietnamese (Chúc Mừng Năm Mới) explores Tet traditions, offering greetings and insights into Vietnam’s Lunar New Year. As the Lunar New Year approaches, Vietnam comes alive with a dazzling array of traditions, vibrant colors, and heartfelt wishes exchanged among friends, families, and strangers alike. 
In a word, no. Tet is lunar new year, or you might know it as Chinese New Year. It occurs on a different day every year, since it marks the night of the first new moon of the year, sometime between January 21st and February 20th. If you’re planning a trip to Vietnam during Tet, read on to find out why this is not a good idea.
