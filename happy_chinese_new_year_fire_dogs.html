She faced what is termed “offending the Grand Duke” or “Fan Tai Sui” (犯太岁) in Mandarin during the last Dog year. This belief holds that sharing your birth year with the current zodiac sign can invite bad luck.

According to Chinese cosmology, each year is associated with one of the five basic elements: gold, wood, water, fire, and earth, resulting in a 60-year cycle. Thus, 2025 is also known as the Year  
A 15-day celebration, Chinese Lunar New Year continues until the full “Snow Moon” signals the beginning of the Lantern Festival on Wednesday, Feb. 12, 2025. 
In Chinese astrology, each year is influenced by one of the five elements: Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, or Water. This means that 2025, for example, is not just a Snake year but a Wood Snake year. 
The most recent year of the Dog was 2018, and the next one will be 2030.
