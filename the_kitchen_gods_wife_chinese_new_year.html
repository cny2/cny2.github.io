        <p>Chinese celebrate the Kitchen God on the 23rd day of the 12th month each lunar year, a day many call “Little New Year.” The family burns a paper effigy of the Kitchen God to send him to Heaven and report to the Jade Emperor whether the family members were naughty or nice. 
In Chinese lore the Kitchen God is sent to watch over families by the Jade Emperor – the all-powerful deity who is thought to decide how fortunate households will be in the new year – and upon  
The Little New Year ( ‘小年--Xiaonian’ in Chinese, also called the Minor New Year’s Day), usually falls a week before the lunar New Year. In 2025, it falls on Jan.22 in northern part of China and Jan.23 in the southern part of China. The Chinese Little New Year is not a fixed festival as it varies with local customs. 
Households will offer a sacrifice called ‘nian gao’ to the Kitchen God on the so called ‘off year’ (the 23rd day of the 12th lunar month), a week before the Chinese New Year. On that day, the Kitchen God ascends to Heaven to present his yearly report about each family member’s behaviour to the Jade Emperor . 
The main Chinese Little New Year traditional activities include: 1. Offering Sacrifices to the Kitchen God Sacrifices to the Kitchen God on Little Year. One of the most important traditions in the Little New Year is to honor the Kitchen God. In Chinese culture, the Kitchen God is the protector of the family from evil spirits. 
The Kitchen God was originally believed to have resided in the stove and only later took on human form. During the Han dynasty, it is believed that a poor farmer named Yin Zifang, was surprised by the Kitchen God who appeared on Chinese New Year as he was cooking his breakfast. Yin Zifang decided to sacrifice his only yellow sheep. 
While the Kitchen God’s main role was not to bring the family together, he still did so on these feast days. Tradition held that the stove could only be properly prepared for the New Year if the entire family was present for the holiday. In Summary. Zao Jun was one name for the Kitchen God, a household deity associated with stoves. 
Zao Jun and the Chinese New Year Celebration. During the Chinese New Year, Zao Jun plays a pivotal role in the festivities. It is customary for families to offer sacrificial ceremonies to the Kitchen God a few days before the lunar New Year’s Eve. These ceremonies involve offering food and burning incense as a gesture of respect and gratitude. 
The Kitchen God's Wife is set largely in early 90s California and in China during World War II. San Francisco, the primary location used in the early chapters of the novel, has a significant Chinese-American population, [ n 1 ] with a significant proportion having moved during and following World War II, as Pearl's mother did, when restrictions  
In Chinese folk religion and Chinese mythology, the Kitchen God, named Zao Jun (Chinese: 灶君; pinyin: Zào Jūn; literally "stove master") or Zao Shen (Chinese: 灶神; pinyin: Zào Shén; literally "stove god"), is the most important of a plethora of Chinese domestic gods (gods of courtyards, wells, doorways, etc.). 
At the banquet, Pearl learns that Helen, Winnie's best friend and co-owner of a flower shop, knows about the disease and threatens to pass the news to Winnie as part of the Chinese New Year ritual of clearing the air of secrets. 
The title is a reference to the forgotten wife of Zao Jun, or the Kitchen God, a figure whose story is similar to that of the novel's co-protagonist, Winnie. [5] Zao Jun was once a hardworking farmer who married a virtuous and kind woman, Guo, but later squandered all their money.

Throughout The Kitchen God's Wife, Tan interweaves critical events of Chinese history with the fictional experiences of her characters. The historical events are not simply employed to provide color and realism, but are integral influences on the story itself. 
For decades—in China and in San Francisco—Winnie Louie and Helen Kwong have kept each other's confidences, but those secrets are about to be revealed. Convinced that she is dying, Helen decides to celebrate the Chinese New Year by unburdening hers

Dew, Robb Forman. Review of The Kitchen God’s Wife. New York Times Book Review 96 (June 16, 1991): 9. This review commends the epic proportions and domestic detail of this compelling but  
The Kitchen God’s Wife sheds light on the low status of women in early 20th-century Chinese society. Arranged marriages illustrate a woman’s lack of autonomy and her inability to seek other paths. 
In 1991, two years after her tremendous success with The Joy Luck Club, Amy Tan published The Kitchen God’s Wife. Like many writers whose first books have received spectacular and widespread attention, Tan admits that she was more than a little apprehensive about the critical and popular reception that her second published novel would receive, 
ing puff of smoke as the image of the Kitchen God is con-sumed in the fire. Ensuring that he says nothing but sweet words in the event that he ever manages to pry his lips open, the air is perfumed with the scent of roasted marshmallows and burning paper. FIG. 1.
