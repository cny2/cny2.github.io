        <h2><strong>japanese new year vs chinese new year special songs for chinese new year</strong></h2>
        <p>The Lunar New Year, also known as Chinese New Year is usually celebrated between late January and February, during the first new moon. This year, it will be on Wednesday, January 2025. But if you’re in Japan, you may be wondering, “Does Japan celebrate Chinese New Year?” Here’s what you should know. Does Japan Celebrate Chinese New Year? 
While Chinese children celebrating Lunar New Year receive money in red envelopes with gold lettering, Japanese children celebrating shōgatsu get their money in white and red envelopes (called otoshidama お年玉, or “year’s jewel”). 
Japanese New Year falls on the 1st of January each year, following the Gregorian calendar. Chinese New Year follows the traditional lunar calendar, for instance, the first day of Chinese New Year this year falls on the 12th of February. What Japanese vs Chinese eat during the New Year 
The short answer is because the Japanese government does not designate the old lunisolar new year as a public holiday. Officially, China does in fact celebrate New Year's Day (元旦) on the Western (Gregorian) 1 January. In contrast, the traditional lunar new year is a public holiday named Spring Festival (春节). 
Though Japanese New Year no longer coincides with the Chinese Spring Festival, Japan still uses a 12-year zodiac that is very similar to the Chinese zodiac, and many nengajō feature the New Year’s zodiac animal. 
Japanese New Year vs Chinese Lunar New Year? Japanese New Year is celebrated on January 1, as per the Gregorian calendar, which began using in 1873. China’s Lunar New Year is celebrated between the first full moon of the new year and early February, giving plenty of time for eating, dancing and parading through Chinatown. 
In modern Japan, the Gregorian New Year is celebrated, so the Lunar New Year is not a part of most Japanese people’s lives. Most Japanese people are unaware of the Lunar New Year and only hear about it mostly as Chinese New Year on the TV news. 
What are the animals of the zodiac? Each year honors an animal based on the Chinese zodiac. The circle of 12 animals — the rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, goat, monkey, rooster, dog and pig — measure the cycles of time. 
The Ryukyuan people, due to their distinctive culture borrowing elements from Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, and especially China, are among the few groups who celebrate the Lunar New Year. They celebrate it three times a year! The first New Year’s celebration is on January 1st, in line with the Japanese tradition. 
Here is our annual guide to help you understand New Year customs in Japan. 2025 is the Year of the Snake, according to the Chinese zodiac. New Year’s Eve - Omisoka (大晦日) Omisoka is the Japanese expression for New Year’s Eve. 
Despite some differences, many Lunar New Year celebrations around the world, whether at the same time as Chinese New Year or not, still do have many striking similarities, largely due to Chinese New Year's massive worldwide influence through the ages. 
Occasionally, about every 24 years, Korean New Year will occur one day after Chinese New Year because of the new moon between Korea’s midnight (15:00UTC) and China’s midnight (16:00UTC). Okay, so nearly everyone in the world has adopted the Gregorian calendar and thus celebrate new year’s day on January 1st. 
China wanted to do everything Western, so it celebrated the January 1 New Year. In fact, in 1949, the Communist Party forbade the celebration of the traditional Chinese New Year. However, by the 1980s, new Chinese leaders had a change of heart and allowed the celebration of the traditional Chinese New Year.
