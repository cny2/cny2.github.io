This year’s 2025 Lunar New Year sign is the snake – so Lunar New Year is referred to as the ‘Year of the Snake’ this time around. The year / animal changes each year, based on the 12 signs of the zodiac – so 2026 will be the Year of the Horse, and 2024 was the Year of the Dragon. 
Chinese New Year 2024 Holiday Dates. In 2025, Chinese New Year Day is on Wednesday, January 29. Everyone will be off work from Saturday January 25 to Sunday, February 2, which is nine days off. This year is a little interesting in that people will have several days off before the actual LNY date.

Welcome to Taiwan, a land where ancient traditions meet modern vibrancy, especially during the Chinese New Year.This guide will take you through the heart of Taiwan’s festive celebrations, offering insights into cultural experiences, travel tips, and must-visit attractions. 
Honestly speaking, the Gregorian calendar New Year is more of a commercial season for domestic and international tourists, and, loosely speaking, the Lunar New Year, aka Chinese New Year, which is especially noted among the communities of ethnic Chinese, is an important time for family members to get together and to indulge themselves in good food. 
My brother came to stay with us last Chinese New Year (or Lunar New Year, but most Taiwanese people I’ve met call it Chinese New Year). I was a little apprehensive about finding things to do during the trip as CNY presents a unique challenge for visitors in that the first few days everything tends to be closed, and then the last few days everything tends to be overwhelmingly busy. 
2025 Taiwan Lunar New Year dates / Taipei Lunar. Lunar New Year in 2025 in Taiwan and Taipei falls on the 29 January 2025. Most Taiwanese and local people will be off the whole week from 25 January to 2 February 2025 and many escape the cities or leave home to celebrate with their families.

Before the New Year, a spring clean is a must.And while it helps to get rid of the junk collected over the year, there’s actually another more important reason for the annual pre-New Year clean up: the idea is that in removing old and unused objects, you’re making room for new luck in the coming year, and that by sweeping dust out the door and cleaning dirt off the windows, you are casting  
What is the Lunar New Year? The Lunar New Year — known as the Spring Festival in China, Tet in Vietnam and Seollal in Korea — is a major festival celebrated in several Asian countries. In Taiwan, this year, people have been drawn to the White Snake Temple to pay their respects.
