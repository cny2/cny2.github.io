        <p>This tray symbolizes a happy and healthy beginning for the Chinese New Year and is often given as a house warming gift to the host of a new years’ get-together. Often, the treats used are symbolic themselves, including special “fortune candies,” and colorful dried fruits that symbolize prosperity and fortune , like apricots, mango, and  
Pomegranates, with their countless seeds, symbolize fertility and abundance. Plus, their bright red color wards off evil spirits. In Chinese tradition, they’re associated with good fortune and many children. So, if you’re hoping for a year full of family togetherness and prosperity, make sure to include pomegranates on your New Year’s  
Dried longans have another name in China: guìyuán (桂圆 /hway-ywen/), which sounds like 'expensive' and 'round' (贵圆) — roundness symbolizes reunion in China. So it is a top Chinese New Year snack due to its implied meanings. 
Apart from lucky dishes, fruits and flowers are important parts of the Chinese New Year. Flowers and fruits hold special significance during Chinese New Year. Here we've rounded up the top lucky flowers and fruits that are most often gifted and used as decorations at Chinese New Year. 1. Tangerine or Kumquat Tree — Wealth and Good Luck 
Grapes are another fruit traditionally embraced in Chinese New Year celebrations, indicating abundance and good fortune. Coming in bunches, they represent a bountiful harvest, and gifting grapes means wishing fruitful luck to others. Whether purple, denoting respect and elegance, or green for vitality and prosperity, grapes are cherished  
The Chinese New Year Tray of Togetherness is filled with traditional chinese new year candies, which is mostly candied fruits and vegetables, and chinese favorites like dried melon seeds. You don't really see these type of candies the rest of the year, but as Chinese New Year comes around they are really being sold everywhere! Yum, yum yum!! 
Munching on seeds during Chinese New Year generally represents the hope for a fruitful and prosperous year. Meanwhile, an assortment of nuts and dried fruits can also be found on the tray, such as: - Pistachios: Represent happiness, as the nuts themselves look like they're smiling. - Peanuts: Represent longevity and prosperity. 
The holiday continues for two weeks, culminating in the Lantern Festival on February 12. Each year, the calendar aligns with an animal in the Chinese zodiac. 2025 is the Year of the Snake, an animal that embodies wisdom, spirituality, elegance and renewal. Like any holiday, Lunar New Year has many traditions. 
Chinese New Year is the most important holiday in Chinese culture. The most important meal of the year is the New Year’s Eve reunion dinner (年夜饭 / Nián yèfàn or 团年饭 tuán niánfàn). No matter where they live, all family members must return to their hometown. 
Re-create the Chinese street snack of sugar-coated fruit that's become a TikTok sensation. 2021 F&amp;W Best New Chef Lucas Sin shares a simplified recipe that sticks to water, sugar, and a little bit  
Fruit is the perfect gift to celebrate the lunar new year. Oranges represent good luck while tangerines, cashews and dried apricots represent wealth. Apples represent wisdom and peace. After this past year, we all need lots of wisdom, peace, good luck and wealth in the year of the Ox!

This Chinese New Year recipe is a delicioso combination of a couple of things I really love: candy and fruit, and something really lucky for the Chinese New Year, the kumquat, or 金橘. 金橘 translates as "gold orange" which symbolizes that good fortune (which for the Chinese always means MONEY!) will find you in the upcoming year. 
Chinese New Year is a rich celebration that happens yearly each winter to kick off the New Year in the Chinese astrological calendar. Each year is represented by an animal. 2025, for example, was the Year of the Snake, an animal that represents introspection, strategic planning and personal growth. 
The special occasion of the year will once again come by. Chinese New Year to me, is so enjoyable not just about the people. The food is what I also really love. I will be sharing with you a super easy and fuss-free recipe. Honey Cornflakes, the name says it all.
