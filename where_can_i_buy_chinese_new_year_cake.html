Nian gao is directly translated to sticky cake, "nian" meaning sticky and "gao" meaning cake.

Tips for the best results. Use a dark sugar. The darker it is, the richer the final color after it steams. Cover with foil or plastic wrap. As the Nian Gao steams, make sure it’s covered with foil or plastic wrap to prevent holes from forming and water droplets landing on its surface.

Ingredient Notes. Please scroll down to the recipe card for the ingredient quantities! Coconut milk and water - The coconut milk gives richness to the nian gao batter and the water helps to thin out the batter to the right consistency. 
The character “年” means “year” and “糕” roughly translates to “cake.” Put together, 年糕 means new year’s cake. In Chinese culture, you eat dishes that carry auspicious meanings during new year celebrations. That means eating foods with names that sound similar to new year’s greetings.
