The beginning of the lunar year has symbolised the act of starting over with renewed hopes for happiness and prosperity. It is also a time to renew ties with family and friends, through family reunion dinners and social visits. Chinese and many other Asian Christians continue to celebrate the New Year so as to maintain their ethnic identity. 
This is why CNY falls on a different date each year. This year, it falls on 12 Feb 2021. It starts on the first day of the new year containing a new moon and ends on the Lantern Festival fourteen days later. Chinese New Year’s Eve and Chinese New Year’s Day are celebrated as a family affair, a time of reunion and thanksgiving.

During the New Year celebration - Bishop Gan writes - Christians can pray, read and meditate on the Word of God, and take care of their neighbour. "The Chinese New Year is a auspicious time to care for others, starting with the elderly, the sick, the lonely and those in difficulty. 
The Chinese New Year (CNY) is a widely celebrated cultural event around the world, especially in places with significant Chinese population.

First, the Chinese calendar is measured by different animals and this year is the year of the rooster and like the Jewish Passover Festival, Chinese New Year is based on the lunar calendar, not the solar calendar.
