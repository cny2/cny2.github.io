        <p>Here are six simple rules of Chinese New Year gift giving etiquette. These etiquette tips will help you give the right gift, in the right way, at the right time. 1. Select the New Year gifts in right colors. When giving a gift at Chinese New Year pay close attention to the color of the gift as well as the wrapping paper or bag in which it is

The time for handing out red envelopes is from the first to the fifteenth day of each Lunar New Year, and because it’s the lunar calendar, the calendar dates will vary from year to year. 
Chinese New Year is a red envelope season. But red envelopes are not limited to Chinese New Year. It is common to give a red envelope during many other occasions, such as a wedding, graduation, the birth of a baby, or a senior person's birthday, and even funerals. It is a traditional way to wish good luck and share blessings. 
6. New notes for ang bao packets Image credit: Unsplash. Never use coins. It’s a tradition to give new single banknotes instead of old ones. Check with your bank to find out when these new notes will be available in time for CNY. Now you know why there are long queues in banks. 
For example, Chinese Singaporeans usually only give around 10-20 SGD. The same goes in Chinese American families where 20 USD would suffice. Any type of Chinese Yuan is also a unique gift for someone who rarely sees Chinese currency. 
Knowing Chinese New Year gift giving etiquette, it is not wise to give presents to a special person at a public occasion, where other attendees may feel disdained and ignored. Nevertheless, it is acceptable in a birthday party or a wedding ceremony. 
It’s traditional to leave a red envelope with two tangerines (leaves on, of course) by a child’s bedside on New Year’s Eve. Given that Chinese New Year isn’t celebrated with material gifts, the amount is usually around $20, enough for the child to buy a toy on his or her own. 
With the festival fast approaching on January 29, 2025, if you want to get involved but are not sure of the etiquette, here’s everything you need to know.The most basic things to remember are to give and receive lai see with two hands and wish everyone the essential Lunar New Year greeting, “Gong hey fat choy,” roughly meaning “Best wishes for prosperity in the new year.” 
People prefer to receive lucky money in lucky amounts. You may wonder what amount will be regarded as auspicious. In the northern region of China, the integral and even number amount are popular, such as 100, 200, 500, 800 and 1000 whereas sums such as 250, 400 or 740 should be avoided. 
New Year Red Packet Traditions. Common amounts for New Year red packets usually end in even numbers, such as 20, 60, or 80, as even numbers are traditionally considered more auspicious. Giving new bills symbolizes a fresh start for the New Year. The amount given to elders should increase yearly.

According to a mixed American and Chinese couple living in the CBD with an annual income of between RMB 200,000 to RMB 500,000 per year: “We have a part-time ayi who doesn’t come on a regular basis, so during Chinese New Year, we give her an RMB 500 hongbao. For the nieces and nephews, we only give them a hongbao if we 
There is an exception to this rule though--you can give an odd number if and only if it is in ONE bill. If you were planning on giving 300, you can go to 288 or 299 because those are auspicious; but if you were planning to give 500, sorry, you gotta go up to 600. (4 is considered unlucky in Chinese.)

Every year around this time there’s a debate in the ayi WeChat groups about whether we should prepare a hongbao for ayi for Chinese New Year (regardless of whether we celebrate it or not) and how much to put in it. 
How much money should I give? Always give what you are comfortable with. This is meant to be a fun tradition for children to celebrate the new year.
