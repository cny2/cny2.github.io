        <h2><strong>should christian celebrate chinese new year chinese new year migration 2025</strong></h2>
        <p>The above guidelines have sought to help us be on guard from turning our celebration of Chinese New Year into a materialistic experience. Being Chinese Christians, we should celebrate Chinese New Year to maintain our ethnic identity and heritage. But as Christians, our real identity is found in our relationship with God, our Creator and Maker. 
Chinese lunar calendar. The Chinese generally have adopted the Western calendar since 1911, but the lunar calendar, based on astrology and the cycles of the moon, is still used for festive occasions such as the Chinese New Year. Astrology is one of China’s most ancient philosophies – perhaps more than 3,000 years old. 
First, the Chinese calendar is measured by different animals and this year is the year of the rooster and like the Jewish Passover Festival, Chinese New Year is based on the lunar calendar, not the solar calendar. This is why Easter falls on a different Sunday every year. During Chinese New Year, almost every home puts banners on their door. 
This is why CNY falls on a different date each year. This year, it falls on 12 Feb 2021. It starts on the first day of the new year containing a new moon and ends on the Lantern Festival fourteen days later. Chinese New Year’s Eve and Chinese New Year’s Day are celebrated as a family affair, a time of reunion and thanksgiving. 
Rev. Elijah from Shanghai believes that Christians should have a correct view of the Chinese New Year celebrations, away from the opinion that this issue is "untouchable". The pastor mentions that the older generation considers that no kitchen knife or cooking are permitted on the first three days of the Chinese lunar new year and bad words are  
Chinese New Year (also called Lunar New Year, celebrated this year on February 5) is the largest holiday for many Asian peoples in terms of scale, importance, and family traditions. The name “Chinese New Year” can be misleading, as multiple Asian countries, such as China, Taiwan, Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Singapore and others, celebrate this  
The beginning of the lunar year has symbolised the act of starting over with renewed hopes for happiness and prosperity. It is also a time to renew ties with family and friends, through family reunion dinners and social visits. Chinese and many other Asian Christians continue to celebrate the New Year so as to maintain their ethnic identity. 
Chinese and many other Asian Christians continue to celebrate the New Year so as to maintain their ethnic identity. But while the celebration was traditionally marked by a religious ceremony in honour of Heaven and Earth, the household gods and ancestors, Chinese Christians will celebrate the event from the perspective of their faith in Christ. 
In such an experience, "we become full of joy and hope for life, we are made new by the love of Christ, in the grace of God." Lent is "the time of preparation for the joy of Easter." And precisely, the time of the Chinese New Year, underlines Mgr Gan, is a golden opportunity to bear witness to the Catholic faith to and with one's family. 
Of course, much of the traditions that come with Chinese New Year are also steeped in some form of superstition or religious practices. But that does not mean that we cannot bring Christ into the picture. Salt&amp;Light gives you five ways you can celebrate Chinese New Year in true Christian style while still honouring the culture. 1. 
First, the Chinese calendar is measured by different animals and this year is the year of the rooster and like the Jewish Passover Festival, Chinese New Year is based on the lunar calendar, not the solar calendar. This is why Easter falls on a different Sunday every year. During Chinese New Year, almost every home puts banners on their door. 
Chinese New Year (CNY), also known as the Lunar New Year or the Spring Festival, is the most important of the traditional Chinese holidays. The date of Chinese New Year is determined by the Chinese calendar, based on a combination of lunar and solar movements. This is why CNY falls on a different date each year. 
Astrology &amp; Zodiac: The Chinese zodiac is based on the lunar calendar and “each year in the repeating zodiac cycle of 12 years is represented by a zodiac animal, each with its own reputed attributes.” 2 This year, Lunar New Year begins on February 10, 2024, which marks the beginning of the Year of the Dragon. 
So there comes the annual question for Christians: Should Christians observe the Chinese New Year? How Should Christians join in the celebration at home? Rev. Li from Jiangxi tells CCD that "the significance of the Spring Festival differs from that in the past so Christians can view it in a different perspective. 
China’s Lantern Festival, or Yuan Xiao Jie, is another example. The festival began long ago as a religious observance but now is often seen simply as a new year’s celebration of traditional Chinese culture. There’s also the traditional Hawaiian hula dance, which began as a form of worship to Laka, the goddess of love, forests, and plants. 
Since the Muslim year is a lunar one consisting of only 354 days, the commencement of the new year fluctuates widely by the Western calendar” (Encyclopedia Americana). The Vietnamese New Year, Tet, falls sometime between January 21 and February 20. And, “the Jewish New Yearis observed during September or early October. 
EVERY year in January or February, Asia hosts the largest annual human migration in the world. Hundreds of millions of Asians return to their families to celebrate the Lunar New Year. * Lunar New Year is the most important festival on the Asian calendar. “[It’s] like New Year’s Day, Fourth of July, Thanksgiving, and Christmas all rolled

I come from a country in Asia, and the tradition in my family is that we celebrate Chinese New Year every year. How should I celebrate this festival in a biblical way, and at the same time honor my non-believing parents? For example: Can I wish others "Gong Xi Fa Cai" which means "wishing you </p>
