Lunar New Year, also known as Chinese New Year or Spring Festival, is a major festival celebrated at the beginning of the Chinese lunisolar calendar. Thought to have originated in ancient China around 3,500 years ago, it is one of the most important holidays in Chinese culture, marking the end of winter and the beginning of the new year. 
Asian communities across the world will begin ringing in the Lunar New Year tomorrow, with 2025 designated as the Year of the Snake in the Chinese zodiac.

Chinese New Year 2025 is a Year of the Snake, more specifically, Wood Snake, starting from January 29th, 2025, and lasting until February 16th, 2026. Recent/upcoming years of the Snake are 2025, 2013, 2001, and 1989. 
In the lunar calendar, the Chinese New Year always falls on the first day of the first month, but its date in the solar calendar changes every year. To keep the Spring Festival's date in the solar calendar relatively stable, an extra month, called a leap month , is added to the lunar calendar every 2-3 years. 
The seventh day of the Lunar New Year (February 4, 2025) is said to be when the Chinese mother goddess, Nuwa, created humanity. Thus, it’s called renri/jan jat (the people’s birthday). 
Just like New Year according to the Gregorian calendar (January 1), Lunar New Year celebrations start on the night before the first day of the new year. ( Note: China follows the Gregorian calendar for daily business but still follows the Chinese calendar for important festivals, auspicious dates for events such as weddings, and the Moon phases.) 
Chinese New Year is the festival that celebrates the beginning of a new year on the traditional Chinese lunisolar calendar. Chinese New Year 2025 will fall on Wednesday, January 29th. The date changes every year but is always somewhere in the period from January 21st to February 20th. 
The key difference between the Lunar New Year and Chinese New Year is while the Lunar New Year is the broader term associated with the start of a new year on the lunar calendar, which is based on the cycles of the moon, the Chinese New Year refers to the cultural traditions associated with celebrations within mainland China and Taiwan. 
The fact is, the Chinese New Year — or the Lunar New Year — isn’t, strictly speaking, purely lunar.  This is a much closer approximation of the true solar year: the number of days it  
They might spend their Chinese New Year's Eve in a foreign country to experience different styles of Chinese New Year. The current population of China is more than 1.41 billion at the end of 2018. Overseas Chinese have at least 50 million. That means more than Chinese 1.46 billion will celebrate the Chinese New Year around the world. 
DURANGO, Colo. — Lunar New Year is the most important holiday for approximately 2 billion people in Asian communities worldwide. With a growing Asian population, Colorado became the second state in the U.S. to recognize Lunar New Year as an official holiday in 2024. Organized celebrations are held  
As in many other calendars, the New Year was based on the northern hemisphere vernal equinox (the beginning of spring). However, the Hindu calendar year was based on the sidereal year (i.e. the movement of the sun relative to the stars), while the Western Gregorian calendar is based on the tropical year (the cycle of seasons). 
The Solar New Year is the beginning of the solar calendar year. This event is observed at different times of year and with varying practices in cultures across the globe. The most common bases chosen to begin a new calendar year are the winter solstice, summer solstice, the spring equinox and the autumnal equinox. South and South-east Asian  
Your birth year determines your Chinese zodiac sign, but it can get tricky, as the lunar calendar varies from the solar, or Gregorian, calendar. Because the dates of Chinese New Year change every year, individuals born in January or February will need to pay special attention to their birth date in addition to their birth year. 
You may have heard of the Chinese New Year being referred to as Lunar New Year. “Lunar” means the start of a new year as marked by the lunar calendar. The Chinese used the lunar calendar for thousands of years until they adopted the Gregorian calendar in the 20th century. Did you know: the Chinese zodiac is based on the lunar calendar. 
Chinese New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, is a time of great celebration in China, characterized by lively traditions and family gatherings.  Spanish Solar Revolution: AI-enhanced
