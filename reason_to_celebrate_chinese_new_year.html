        <p>In this presentation, we will explore the history and customs of Chinese New Year and delve into the reasons why it is such a cherished and revered holiday in Chinese culture. Presentation: 1. Historical Origins: – Chinese New Year has a history dating back thousands of years, with its origins rooted in ancient Chinese mythology and folklore. 
There are several reasons to celebrate Chinese New Year: First, legend states that the Chinese New Year stemmed from an ancient battle against the Nian, a terrifying beast that attacked people and ate children. The people used fireworks and firecrackers to chase the beast away. 
Since the mid-1990s people in China have been given seven consecutive days off work during the Chinese New Year. This week of relaxation has been designated Spring Festival, a term that is sometimes used to refer to the Chinese New Year in general. The origins of the Chinese New Year are steeped in legend. One legend is that thousands of years  
Chinese New Year (Lunar New Year) is a time for families to be together. Chinese New Year's Eve is the most important time. Wherever they are, people are expected to be home to celebrate the festival with their families. The Chinese New Year's Eve dinner is called 'reunion dinner'. Big families of several generations sit around round tables and  
Chinese New Year, also known as the Lunar New Year or the Spring Festival, is the most important among the traditional Chinese festivals. The origin of the Chinese New Year Festival can be traced back to about 3,500 years ago. Chinese New Year has evolved over a long period of time and its customs have undergone a long development process. 
The highlight of the celebration is Chinese New Year's Eve, when families gather for a reunion feast of symbolic foods, including dumplings shaped like ancient Chinese gold ingots that represent wealth, and fish, which in Chinese is a homonym of "abundance." The fish must be only partially eaten because the leftovers signify continuing prosperity. 
Chinese New Year is a festival beyond compare. Technically it’s a week—determined by the lunar calendar but always late January to mid-February—but for many, Chunjie (Spring Festival) is  
It is not only celebrated in China. Vietnam, Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore also celebrate the Lunar New Year holiday. The two-week celebration includes family and friends, feasting and fireworks, parties and parades. For more than 3,000 years, Lunar New Year was just what it sounds like—the beginning of a new year in the Chinese calendar.

The words Yuandan and Xinnian were created to mark the turn between two years. Towards Tang and Song Dynasties, the celebration was given a name Yuanri. In the flourishing Tang Dynasty (618 - 907 AD), the function of Chinese New Year had shifted from worshiping and praying to social entertainment. People got public holidays for staying with  
The Basics. Much like the celebration of the New Year in the Western world, Chinese New Year is all about the hopeful spirit of renewal. The holiday’s traditions, symbols and rituals are all meant to wipe the slate clean and prepare for prosperity, good luck and happiness in the new year. 
This is one of the reasons why even non-Tsinoys celebrate Chinese New Year. While the more traditional Chinese New Year customs—like the dragon and lion dances, the noodle toss, among others—continue to be practiced by Filipino-Chinese families and even in some commercial establishments (hotels and restaurants), these are not observed by many. 
8 Reasons to Celebrate Chinese New Year. Chinese New Year is right around the corner, complete with two weeks of celebrations observed by people across the world. Since 8 is a lucky number, here are eight great reasons to embrace the holiday. Skip cleaning for nearly a week. In the weeks leading up to the start of Chinese New Year, people clean  
Put up red decorations. Red is the color or symbol of good luck in Chinese culture and is often used for new year decorations. The number "8" also symbolizes good luck and wealth, since the Chinese character for eight rhymes with fortune or wealth. 
The Chinese New Year, also called Spring Festival, is the most important and widely celebrated festival of all in China. It is celebrated from the 1st day of the 1st lunar month to the 15th day of the 1st lunar month. 
It is an important custom to set off firecrackers and fireworks during the Chinese New Year period. Chinese New Year celebrations would not be complete without them. Why Light Firecrackers on Chinese New Year? In traditional Chinese culture, firecrackers were originally used to scare away evil spirits. As the legend goes, a monster called Nian  
While most Westerners experience ‘Chinese New Year’ by watching parades in Chinatown and having a great meal, its traditions vary from country to country. The holiday is more aptly called ‘Lunar New Year’, as it marks the start of a new lunar cycle, and is one of the most important holidays in Asia. 
As the last day of the lunar year, Chinese New Year's Eve (除夕 chú xī) is the day before Chinese New Year. It is a grand reunion time for the whole Chinese family. People will participate in many activities to celebrate the coming new year. Chinese New Year's Eve Traditions 1. Putting Up New Year Decorations
