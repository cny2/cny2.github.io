        <p>According to the Chinese Zodiac, the year 2025 is the year of the snake. This animal has long been regarded in Japan as an auspicious being that brings about good fortune and fertility.

Why not make your year auspicious by visiting places associated with snakes, receiving gifts, and paying a visit to temples and shrines that are associated  
On New Year’s Eve, and on the first three days of the New Year (1, 2 and 3 January), Kyotoites visit either their local neighborhood shrine or one of Kyoto’s major shrines to pay for luck, success and health in the New Year. Visitors to Kyoto are more than welcome to join. Just be ready for crowds! For more on Hatsumode see our New Year’s

January in Kyoto is rich in traditional events celebrating the New Year. Various New Year's events that have been passed down since ancient times color Kyoto during this period. Hatsumode (January 1-7, 2025) Hatsumode is a traditional Japanese custom of visiting a shrine or temple for the first time in the New Year to pray for safety and peace  
The Kitamukizan Fudoin temple in Fushimi Ward has installed the papier-mache piece in its main hall with the year of the snake in the Chinese astrological calendar just around the corner. 
Heian Jingu Shrine is a popular New Year's visiting spot that was established to commemorate the 1100th anniversary of the relocation of the capital to Heian (now Kyoto) in 794, attracting about 400,000 visitors during the first three days of the New Year. 
Kyoto is home to many historic shrines and temples. Many people from Japan and abroad visit the city around the New Year, offering thanks for the past year and praying for good health and safety in the new year. If you want to enjoy Kyoto while avoiding the crowds, we recommend staying at Hotel Noum OSAKA. 
Most businesses are closed for this period. It’s a restful yet exciting time where people eat special traditional dishes, visit loved ones, send postcards, and attend New Year parties. The Japanese New Year is one of the most important holidays in Japan, and this is why Hatsumode is such a big deal for Japanese people. 
The Chinese zodiac sign for 2025 is "Snake," meaning snake. Snakes have long been considered lucky creatures. This article introduces seven temples and shrines in Kyoto that are recommended for zodiac year pilgrimages. 
In this article, I would like to introduce how I spent my first New Year in Kyoto! Various events are held at shrines and temples to celebrate the New Year. Especially from New Year’s Eve to New Year, shrines and temples in Kyoto City welcome worshippers throughout the night, and many people visit shrines and temples for “Hatsumode”. 
We introduce Kyoto restaurants open at the end of the year 2024 and the beginning of the year 2025 (three days of New Year's Eve)! Enjoy delicious food and drinks with your family or friends you haven't seen in a while to start the year 2025. Choose from Kyoto cuisine, Japanese cuisine, yakiniku, cafes, etc., according to your dining situation. 
New Years Day in Kyoto After a very relaxing nights rest, we woke up early to get some breakfast. The hotel had a restaurant, but it was 3,300 yen ($35 USD) per person. 
What is Lunar New Year? Lunar New Year, also known as Chinese New Year or Spring Festival, marks the start of a new zodiac cycle based on the Chinese lunar calendar. Each year, the date shifts within the Gregorian calendar. Lunar New Year is celebrated around the world, particularly in Asian countries like China, shown here (Beijing). 
JAN 1-3, 2025: WHAT’S OPEN IN KYOTO? I don’t want you to get caught out (like I have) during the New Year period in Kyoto ( or any part of Japan actually.) Many people think I’m exaggerating almost EVERYTHING is closed down (especially once you step out of the city.) I wanted to use this post to suggest some Jan 1-3, 2025 options. 
Pre-Chinese New Year Preparations and Activities (Jan. 7–Feb. 12, 2025) Jan. 7, 2025: Laba Festival. Some Chinese start to celebrate and prepare for Chinese New Year as early as day 8 of the 12 th month of the lunar calendar.
