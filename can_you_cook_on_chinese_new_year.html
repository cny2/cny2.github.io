        <p>The Year of the Snake 🐍 (蛇年) is fast approaching!In 2025, the Chinese Lunar New Year falls on Wednesday, January 29, and the celebration lasts at least 15 days.To help you prepare for celebratory meals, I’ve curated 30 popular recipes for this most important occasion. 
Chinese New Year Side Dishes. Even some vegetable dishes are iconic Chinese New Year foods. Buddha’s Delight, consisting of at least 8 ingredients, is often eaten the morning of Chinese New Year after a ceremonial offering of food to honor family ancestors. 
Yes, Chinese New Year is the best time to savor traditional dishes, candies, and pastries without guilt. The New Year’s Eve dinner, also known as the “reunion dinner” or 团年饭, is a feast that brings families together, exchanging best wishes for each other. And that’s why Chinese New Year recipes are more than the flavors.

Most Americans consider January 1 the start of the new year, but many Asians and Asian-Americans don’t. Instead, they follow Lunar New Year, also referred to as Chinese New Year in the U.S., which begins on January 29, 2025. (That’s the Year of the Snake in the Chinese zodiac, BTW.) 
When is the 2025 Chinese new year? It's the Year of the Snake! The Lunar New Year officially begins on January 29th at sundown, and ends on February 12th. People all over the world celebrate the new year in accordance with the traditional lunar calendar. It's the biggest holiday in China, with celebrations lasting for weeks! 
This is a colorful Chinese New Year sticky rice pudding that's layered with eight different kinds of ingredients. In this version, pineapple, pumpkin seeds, peanuts, dates, mandarin oranges, red bean paste, and walnuts make up the 8 treasures but different families will use different grains, nuts, and dried fruits. 
Serve this spicy pork-and-vegetable lo mein for Chinese New Year or for dinner anytime. While some cooks like to cut the noodles into 6- to 8-inch lengths to make them easier to combine with other ingredients, for the New Year the noodles can never be cut because that symbolizes bad luck. The longer the noodles, the longer your life! 
In Chinese, fish is called “Yu”, which has the similar pronunciation of “surplus”. So eating fish in Chinese New Year expresses a good wish of abundance and prosperity in the next year. Steamed Perch is one of the most popular Chinese New Year recipes of fish, with a good appearance of a whole fish, fresh taste, and easy cooking skills. 
Chinese New Year traditions can vary greatly across the different parts of China. The landmass of China is almost as large as the US, but its cultural diversity is as dense as in Europe. It’s the same idea when it comes to food, especially at Chinese New Year. 
Taking naps, especially on the first day of the Chinese New Year, represents laziness. In Chinese culture, taking naps on the first day of the new year will affect your luck and career for the rest of the year. 9. Avoid breaking things in your home 
Chinese New Year Snacks. Traditional snacks for Chinese New Year celebrations include: Chinese nut cookies, such as peanut cookies or Cantonese walnut cookies. (If deep frying your own nuts, the peanut cookies will take you over half a day to roast and skin- I made 1500 peanut cookies last year and have baked another 40 bottles in the last 2 weeks to come up with The Ultimate Chinese Peanut  
If you are going to eat it in less than 10 days, just leave it in the fridge, tightly sealed in a ziplock bag. But for longer storage, say a month or so, you could wrap it in plastic wrap, then a paper towel, then inside a freezer bag. I would also cut up the cake so it is easier to defrost when you want to cook it. 
You can reheat them in a 400°F (200°C) oven until heated through and turning crispy again. How to serve sesame balls. You can serve sesame balls when they are warm or at room temperature as a dim sum course or a dessert after the meal. It’s a very common dessert / snack to cook for Chinese New Year in the southern part of China. 
The culinary delights that accompany this festive season are more than just food; they are symbols of luck, prosperity, and togetherness.

In Chinese, "fish" (鱼 Yú /yoo/) sounds like 'surplus'. Fish is a traditional Chinese New Year dish on the Chinese New Year dinner menu.
