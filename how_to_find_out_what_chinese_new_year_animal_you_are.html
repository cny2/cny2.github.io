Below is our Chinese zodiac calculator. You can use it to find out about your Chinese zodiac sign and discover your horoscope for 2025. 
The Chinese zodiac, known as Sheng Xiao or Shu Xiang, features 12 animal signs in this order: Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Sheep, Monkey, Rooster, Dog and Pig. 2025 is the Year of the Snake according to Chinese zodiac, starting from the 2025 Chinese New Year on Jan. 29th and lasting to 2026 Lunar New Year's Eve on Feb. 16. 2026 is the Year of the Horse. 
The most common-seen method depends on Chinese New Year, which is considered as the division of two animal years. When a lunar year comes to an end, the animal will shift to next one. Chinese people’s animal signs are marked by this method. The other method is calculated on solar calendar. In China, one year can be divided into 24 solar terms

The chinese calendar, being a lunisolar calendar, has no fixed date to mark the beginning of a year. e.g., The date of Chinese new year in 2025 is January 28. So a person born before the chinese new year has different animal sign from those born on or after the chinese new year even if they are are born in the same year in gregorian calendar. 
The most common way to calculate a person’s zodiac sign is to use the Chinese traditional new year as the new year. As the Chinese New Year usually falls during 21 January and February 20, if your birthday is during this period in Gregorian date, you may belong to the zodiac sign of the last year. You can check the following chart to know
