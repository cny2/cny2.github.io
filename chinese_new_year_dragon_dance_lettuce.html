        <p>Chinese New Year’s is here, and in Hawaii that means a visit from our favorite, jubilant, sometimes scary Chinese lions.

However, the symbolism goes far behind some discount produce you can find at Costco.

All over the world at New Year, dancers dress as a dragon and dance through the streets, spreading good luck. The longer the dragon (the more dancers it has), the luckier it will be.
