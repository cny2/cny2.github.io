Festival of the Heavenly God or Jade Emperor (9th day of the Chinese lunar calendar) - Hokkien New Year. This festival starts on the early morning of the 9th day of the Chinese lunar calendar (after midnight of the 8th day). 
The ninth day of the first lunar calendar is especially significant to the Hokkien people (subgroup of Chinese). Some traditionalists would even venture as far as to say that it is much more important than the Chinese New Year day itself because the entire Hokkien clan was spared from massacre. 
Basically, Hokkien New Year is celebrated on the 9th day of Chinese New Year. (If you remember, I previously mentioned that Chinese New Year is a fifteen day celebration). For us Hokkiens, it is celebrated with more grandeur compared to the 1st day. 
On the ninth day of the Chinese New Year it would be the celebration known to the Hokkiens as “Phai Thien Kong” which literally means “praying the Heaven God”. Prayers usually starts from 11pm on the 8th day or midnight onwards on the 9th day.
