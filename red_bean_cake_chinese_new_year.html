Watch Daddy Lau teach us how to make nian gao with red bean, also known as nìhn gōu or Chinese New Year Cake. This video includes our family's nian gao recip 
Unlike the typical New Year’s cake, her version is made with Coconut Milk and a delicious layer of red bean filling in the middle. Mrs. Leong’s recipe carries a long and notable history. Essentially, it remains true to its originator: an Admiral’s daughter born in China during the late 1800’s.

It is essential during Chinese new year because cake in Chinese-“Gao”(糕), sounds like “high”(高) in Mandarin. Nian Gao- higher and better every year! 
Then, I found a children's book in the library, a Chinese version of The Gingerbread Man, which included a recipe for a baked Nian Gao with a red bean paste layer sandwiched inside the rice cake. Intrigued by this, I gave it a try and brought it to my young son’s class for a Lunar New Year celebration. 
Cut the dough into 6 even small pieces and roll them into small, flat circles. Put the red bean filling into the center of the dough skin, about 1 tablespoon of filling. 
Recipe Notes. To cook adzuki beans, soak 1 cup dried adzuki beans overnight. Then place drained beans in Instant Pot or pressure cooker; add enough water to cover by 1" for 5-7 minutes. 
Grease the bottom and the side of a 7 or 8-inch round pan. 7-inch pan will yield a bit taller cake. Pour half of the batter into the pan and then use a spoon to top with 3/4 of the red beans. 
Red Bean Cake (紅豆糕) actually refers to two different dishes. One of them is a summer sweet treat made of red beans (aka Azuki Beans) and coconut milk with jelly-like consistency; the other one is the traditional steamed red bean rice cake made during Chinese New Year and exchanged between families and relatives. In creating today’s dish

Sticky rice is considered good luck for Chinese New Year because it’s symbolic of family cohesiveness, and it’s Chinese characters sound like “getting higher with each year,” implying prosperity in business, better grades, and promotions.

Glutinous rice flour (Nuo Mi Fen/糯米粉). The most important ingredient of Nian Gao, it’s made of finely ground glutinous rice (aka sweet white rice). It’s characterised by its sticky, stretchy nature once cooked, thus the name.
