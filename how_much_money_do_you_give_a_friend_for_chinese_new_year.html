        <p>When do you give it? For anyone who has felt awkward at Chinese New Year, here’s a simple guide to navigating the social minefield of red envelopes – condensed into eight simple rules. 1. You give out red envelopes if you’re married. Don’t commit the classic faux-pas of handing out one red envelope from the two of you. Both spouses give  
Here are six simple rules of Chinese New Year gift giving etiquette. These etiquette tips will help you give the right gift, in the right way, at the right time. 1. Select the New Year gifts in right colors. When giving a gift at Chinese New Year pay close attention to the color of the gift as well as the wrapping paper or bag in which it is  
Chinese New Year is a red envelope season. But red envelopes are not limited to Chinese New Year. It is common to give a red envelope during many other occasions, such as a wedding, graduation, the birth of a baby, or a senior person's birthday, and even funerals. It is a traditional way to wish good luck and share blessings. 
10. What to say when you give/receive an ang bao Image credit: Unsplash. Gong Xi Fa Cai! – Wishing you happiness and prosperity (use this when receiving gifts or Ang Bao) Xin Nian Kuai Le – Happy New Year (used as a general Chinese New Year greeting) Huat ah! – Wishing yourself prosperity (generally shouted while tossing yu sheng/lo hei) 
Yes. If you do not have a certain idea on what material items to give, and then the monetary gift is a good choice during Chinese New Year. Chinese people like to exchange red envelopes with luck money inside. Especially for kids, the red envelopes are recommended. 
So How Much Should You Really Give? Like birthday money, there are no set rules. For immediate family and close relatives, lucky money ranges anywhere from 200-1000 CNY. The closer they are, the heftier the sum. Most reserve the thickest envelope for their parents. (Chinese parents usually don’t like taking money from their children though.) 
With the festival fast approaching on January 29, 2025, if you want to get involved but are not sure of the etiquette, here’s everything you need to know.The most basic things to remember are to give and receive lai see with two hands and wish everyone the essential Lunar New Year greeting, “Gong hey fat choy,” roughly meaning “Best wishes for prosperity in the new year.” 
This year’s Chinese New Year falls on Feb 10. One of the things that everyone associates with Chinese New Year is hongbao (红包) — money-filled red packets given to family, friends, colleagues, and employees. Every year around this time, I always find myself checking in with others about how much to put in the envelopes. 
Relation to Person Recommended Ang Bao Rate Why this amount? Parents, In-laws and Grandparents. $188 - $388. A way to show respect, gratitude and filial piety to your parents for raising and  
New Year Red Packet Taboos. Always use a new red packet envelope; do not reuse last year’s or previously used ones. Do not give red packets with odd numbers (100, 300, 500) and avoid amounts with the number “4”. Do not give an empty red packet. The money inside the red packet should not be folded. 
If you were planning on giving 300, you can go to 288 or 299 because those are auspicious; but if you were planning to give 500, sorry, you gotta go up to 600. (4 is considered unlucky in Chinese.) Reply reply 
Well, you can go on a holiday during Lunar New Year but people will remember you as the cheapskate person who’s perpetually overseas only on CNY, and do you really want that rep? 9. Don’t forget the finishing touches. When giving or receiving red packets, always use both hands – it’s a sign of respect. And don’t skimp on the well

When you visit relatives, friends or colleges, red envelopes, cigarettes, alcohol, tea, fruits, and health foods are good choices. You’d better choose four kinds of material gifts, or if you do not have an ideal Chinese New Year gift idea, just give a red envelope, which is the most welcomed and direct way to show your sincerity and affection. 
1. Chinese New Year. When visiting family and friends during the Chinese New Year holiday, be prepared with a fistful of red packets to hand out in every household in which you encounter children, e.g. unmarried, young dependents, typically teenagers and younger.

The assumption is the younger ones aren’t as well off and you’re helping them by starting the new year with money in their pocket. Giving to your elders can be seen as insulting in this situation. Unless you know your parents and family will take it in the right way, I wouldn’t do it. </p>
