There are so many lessons wrapped up in one movie, one true story. Fred Rogers was a man who walked the walk and showed us how forgiveness and kindness could change lives (young and more mature). Forgiveness releases the person who needs forgiveness as well as the person doing the forgiving.

Born in '77 and yeah, Mr Rogers was a huge part of my childhood. I can't help but tear up and get nostalgic any time he comes up. I'm pretty firmly NOT religious at all - but I believe if those who claim to be practiced what he did; this country would be a far better place. Fred Rogers was the definition of "national treasure." </p>
