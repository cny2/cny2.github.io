Kwong Ming has been a local name for my entire life. I grew up near by in the 60's and a few times we would venture here from a few towns over. I had not been there in over 30 years and then the name came up twice. Once, as the Best Of 2011 and a group of foodies mentioned that this was the only Chinese resturant that they would even go to anymore. 
Recently redone dinning room, looks really good. This place has become my favorite Chinese spot. Food is so good, have never been disappointed in anything I've eaten here. Also enjoy Chinese New Year celebration banquet every February. House made table noodle are the bomb.

Kwong Ming last night. This is an old school sit down Chinese restaurant. The atmosphere is reminiscent of Chinese restaurants of yesteryear. We decided to order the shrimp dumplings. I always love these. They are filled with big pieces of shrimp in a light wrapper. My husband wanted the poo poo platter. I was hesitant. I'm so glad we had it! 
Ever since then, every time I order they tell me 45 minutes but it shows up in 20 to 25. The portions are large, and everything I've ordered from them over the years has been excellent! There are a lot of other Chinese restaurants in Hollywood, and they're all garbage except for Kwong Ming. It's a once a week habit, and every week I never go wrong.

Oh Kwong MingI've heard many things. Finally made in! Very old-school Chinese for sure! "Column A, Column B" as well as other classic and American-ized Chinese dishes. My mom and I decided to order of the columns. With this meal choice we each got soup, choice of appetizer and dessert. For soup, I chose wonton and my mom chose egg drop wonton. 
Old time, top shelf, every table full on the weekends, Chinese Restaurant. Worthy of a nice evening out. Takeout just as good, a bit cheap on the to go fresh duck sauce. Two egg rolls gave 1 and Chinese guy made jokes about telling him two. Don't let em get away with that. Lol! 
After missing out on a friends Chinese night out and wife raving about Kwong Ming I had to take my family ASAP. We ordered all the favorites and they were all delicious. If some one mentions kwong Ming they usually mention the famous egg rolls. Well now I know why so huge delious and right up there with the best tasting egg rolls I had.
