        <p>The Chinese New Year dinner also referred to as the "Reunion Dinner", called tuan nien fan or nian ye fan in Chinese, is perhaps the most loved aspect of the Spring Festival. It takes place on Chinese New Year's Eve (January 28th in 2025). The Significance of the Reunion Dinner 
In Chinese, "fish" (鱼 Yú /yoo/) sounds like 'surplus'. Fish is a traditional Chinese New Year dish on the Chinese New Year dinner menu. Chinese people always like to have a surplus at the end of the year, because they think if they have managed to save something at the end of the year, then they can make more in the next year. 
From golden dumplings that resemble ancient currency to sticky rice cakes symbolising rising success, every item on the reunion dinner table is chosen with care to ensure the New Year is off to an auspicious start. So, this year, impress your aunties and uncles by decoding the hidden meanings behind these iconic dishes. 
Chinese New Year’s Eve dinner is called “reunion dinner,” meant to be celebrated surrounded by multiple generations of family as they wish each other blessings and hopes for the year to come. 
The Chinese New Year's Eve and Chinese New Year's reunion dinner is very large and traditionally includes dumplings, chicken, and pork. Fish (魚, yú; Vietnamese: Con cá) is also included, but intentionally (except for Vietnam) not finished, and the remaining fish is stored overnight.

This article will explore the cultural importance, gastronomic pleasures, and familial customs that make the Chinese New Year’s Eve Dinner so special  
Lunar New Year’s Eve: The Reunion Dinner. At the heart of Lunar New Year celebrations is the reunion dinner on Lunar New Year’s Eve, which falls on January 28, 2025. A traditional reunion dinner has many dishes, including steamed or fried fish, rice cakes and balls, noodles and dumplings. 
Many vegetables and meats have symbolic meanings as well. For example: Eggs: big and healthy family. Lobster: endless money rolling in. Shrimp: fortune and wealth. Roasted pig: peace. Duck: loyalty. Peaches: longevity. Tofu: happiness and fortune for the entire family. Fish: surplus and wealth. Steamed Fish 蒸鱼 (zhēng yú) Fish is a must  
Celebrating the Spring Festival dinner, or reunion dinner (年夜饭 Nian Ye Fan), is very important to Chinese people, and the whole family must get gather to enjoy a sumptuous meal . Chicken, duck, fish and pork are necessary.

These easy Chinese New Year desserts are perfect to usher in the new year, but they’re delightful all year round. Chinese New Year is a significant holiday in Chinese culture, where families gather and share the most important meal of the year – tuán niánfàn or New Year’s Eve dinner. 
The Chinese New Year's Eve dinner is a reunion dinner for the family, and this is the richest and most important dinner at the end of the year.  The meaning of New  
Most Americans consider January 1 the start of the new year, but many Asians and Asian-Americans don’t. Instead, they follow Lunar New Year, also referred to as Chinese New Year in the U.S., which begins on January 29, 2025. (That’s the Year of the Snake in the Chinese zodiac, BTW.) 
Honoring the dead is a Chinese New Year's tradition that's kept to the word. Many Chinese people visit ancestors' graves on the day before the Chinese New Year's day, offer sacrifices to ancestors before the reunion dinner (to show that they are letting their ancestors "eat" first), and add an extra glass and place it at the dinner table on New Year's eve. 
The Chinese zodiac’s traditions and customs resonate through our actions even in contemporary settings. As the Year of the Snake approaches, we should not underestimate the influence of some of the common folklore beliefs. 
The lunisolar Chinese calendar determines the date of Lunar New Year. The calendar is also used in countries that have been influenced by, or have relations with, China – such as Korea, Japan, and Vietnam, though occasionally the date celebrated may differ by one day or even one moon cycle due to using a meridian based on a different capital city in a different time zone or different  
On the New Year’s Eve dinner table, generally there are chicken (meaning good luck), fish (meaning surplus every year), oyster sauce (meaning good market), hair weeds (meaning rich), dried beancurd sticks (meaning abundance), lotus root (meaning smart), lettuce (meaning money-making), sausage (meaning permanence) for good luck.
