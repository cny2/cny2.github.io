Think you are being culturally sensitive when you wish people “Happy Lunar New Year” instead of “Happy Chinese New Year”? Think again. A week before Jan 29, which is when Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese people usher in the Year of the Snake, Chagee, a Chinese bubble tea brand popular both in and outside China, found itself in hot water  
This year, the Chinese New Year 2023, will fall on Sunday, January 22nd, 2023 and end on February 5th, 2023. The Chinese New Year is celebrated for 16 days. Wait, can I still say Chinese New Year, or should I say Lunar New Year, Spring Festival, or something else? With the intention of being inclusive, what should this Holiday be called? 
Lunar New Year greetings can be fun but stressful. Here’s a guide. Happy Lunar New Year! If you want to greet your relatives or impress your friends, here are some popular Mandarin and Cantonese  
More authentic Chinese New Year greetings include: "过年好！" (Guònián hǎo!) - Happy New Year! "给你拜年啦！" (Gěi nǐ bàinián la!) - I'm here to wish you a Happy New Year! "虎年大吉！" (Hǔ nián dàjí!) - Good luck in the Year of the Tiger! (As the coming Chinese new year is the year of the Tiger) "新年快乐  
Chinese New Year is a time of celebration and giving. More likely than not, you’ll be giving out some gifts here and there. But even with gifts, there’s some etiquette you need to take note of, especially during the Lunar New Year. Always keep in mind that colour has large significance in the Chinese culture. 
The Chinese word for “book” (shū) sounds exactly the same as the word for “lose” – so buying a book right after ringing in the New Year is considered an invitation for bad luck. 
Is it OK to say Happy Chinese New Year? In Mandarin, “Happy Chinese New Year” is “xin nian kuai le” (pronounced shin nee-an kwai le), which is a formal greeting typically used for strangers and means “New Year happiness.” A shortened version is “xin nian hao” (pronounced shin nee-an how) is more often used for friends and family. 
In 2025, Jan. 29 marks the start of the Lunar New Year, also known in China as the Chinese New Year or Spring Festival, China’s biggest holiday. The world’s largest human migration takes place

Is it OK to say 'Happy New Year' (in English), or some other English phrase, at some point after the Chinese New Year (which I believe is 23rd January this year) ? Is saying it before the date OK ?

The Basics of Chinese New Year Greetings. When it comes to Chinese New Year, the greeting you’ll hear most often is “新年快乐 (Xīnnián kuàilè),” which directly translates to “Happy New Year.” It’s a warm, universally understood phrase used across China and beyond. However, the beauty of Chinese language lies in its diversity. 
The Year of the Snake in 2025 brings a time for new beginnings, family reunions, and well wishes. Celebrating the Lunar New Year is marked by reflecting on the past and looking forward to a future  
For years, many people—especially in non-Chinese-speaking countries—have assumed that “ Kung Hei Fat Choi ” directly translates to “Happy New Year.” However, the phrase actually means “Wishing you prosperity and wealth.” While this is an auspicious and widely-used greeting during Chinese New Year, it does not express the general  
The Chinese New Year is a wonderful time for family reunions, new beginnings, renewed romance, and the potential for a happy year ahead. It’s an opportunity to extend your wishes to friends, family, lovers, colleagues, clients, or business partners during this widely celebrated lunar New Year holiday.
