        <h2><strong>how to find out what animal you are in the chinese new year what to do with chinese new year money</strong></h2>
        <p>Traditionally, Chinese people believe that each zodiac sign has fated personality traits and each different zodiac year has a lot to do with personal horoscopes. Below is our Chinese zodiac calculator. You can use it to find out about your Chinese zodiac sign and discover your horoscope for 2025. 
The Chinese zodiac, known as Sheng Xiao or Shu Xiang, features 12 animal signs in this order: Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Sheep, Monkey, Rooster, Dog and Pig. 2025 is the Year of the Snake according to Chinese zodiac, starting from the 2025 Chinese New Year on Jan. 29th and lasting to 2026 Lunar New Year's Eve on Feb. 16. 2026 is the Year of the Horse. 
The most common-seen method depends on Chinese New Year, which is considered as the division of two animal years. When a lunar year comes to an end, the animal will shift to next one. Chinese people’s animal signs are marked by this method. The other method is calculated on solar calendar. In China, one year can be divided into 24 solar terms  
The Chinese New Year (Spring Festival) usually falls during 21 January and February 20, if your birthday is during this period in Gregorian date, you may belong to the zodiac sign of the last year. In the following table, the years’ starting and ending dates are clearly shown which help you determine your animal sign correctly. 
The Chinese astrological sign changes every lunar year, according to a cycle of 60 years. Thus, each of the 12 animals of the Chinese zodiac, Rat, Ox (Buffalo), Tiger, the Rabbit (Hare, Cat), Dragon, Snake, Horse, Sheep (Goat), Monkey, Dog and Pig (Boar) is associated with an element of Chinese cosmology, Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal and Water (12 x 5 = 60 years). 
The Chinese zodiac includes 12 animal signs, in order they are: Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog and Pig. The Lunar New Year, or Spring Festival, marks the transition from one animal to the next—2024 is the year of the Dragon, which began on February 10th, 2024, and ends on February 24th, 2024. 
The chinese calendar, being a lunisolar calendar, has no fixed date to mark the beginning of a year. e.g., The date of Chinese new year in 2025 is January 28. So a person born before the chinese new year has different animal sign from those born on or after the chinese new year even if they are are born in the same year in gregorian calendar. 
Chinese Zodiac sign is based on one’s year of birth according to the Chinese lunar calendar. People under different signs have unique characters and fortune. You can find out your animal signs quickly according to the zodiac years chart below and click the animal sign to view more information about the sign. 
The most common way to calculate a person’s zodiac sign is to use the Chinese traditional new year as the new year. As the Chinese New Year usually falls during 21 January and February 20, if your birthday is during this period in Gregorian date, you may belong to the zodiac sign of the last year. You can check the following chart to know  
Every Chinese zodiac year from 1900–2031, full table and broken down by each zodiac. Find your year, animal, dates and element (metal, water, wood, fire, earth).
