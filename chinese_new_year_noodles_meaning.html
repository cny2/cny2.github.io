A Celebratory Banquet Noodle Dish. Whether it’s a birthday, a new baby, a wedding, or a lunar new year banquet, long life noodles are an important aspect of all these happy events. If you’re lucky enough to have attended a Chinese banquet, you already know that Long Life Noodles and Banquet Fried Rice are two of the last items served. 
Long Noodles for Long Life. The history of noodles in Chinese culture goes back millennia, with the tradition of long noodles for the Lunar New Year stretching back more than a thousand years. They're called "longevity noodles," and it's said the longer the noodles, the better they represent a long, comfortable and healthy life. 
This traditional belief has led to the creation of a specific type of noodle named “longevity noodles / 长寿面” These noodles are often served during special occasions such as birthday celebrations and Chinese New Year’s Eve. The longevity noodles dish is a must-have dish during the reunion dinner. As family members from near and far

These two-foot-long noodles make an appearance at birthdays in addition to the Chinese New Year, representing the wish for a long, happy, and healthy life.

Longevity noodles are a popular Lunar New Year dish. The Chinese believe these egg-wheat noodles ensure a long life. The strands are to be eaten whole without breaking into pieces: The longer they remain intact, the longer your lifespan 
Have you ever wondered why certain dishes take centre stage during Chinese New Year celebrations? It’s not just about the tantalising flavours—it’s about tradition, symbolism, and a sprinkle of superstition. For over 2,000 years, Chinese culture has infused food with deeper meaning, believing  
Food plays a huge role in celebrating the Lunar New Year. Chinese Lunar New Year dishes aren’t just delicious—they’re packed with meaning. Each dish represents something special, like wealth, health, or happiness. When you share these meals with loved ones, you’re not just eating. 
In Chinese, "fish" (鱼 Yú /yoo/) sounds like 'surplus'. Fish is a traditional Chinese New Year dish on the Chinese New Year dinner menu. Chinese people always like to have a surplus at the end of the year, because they think if they have managed to save something at the end of the year, then they can make more in the next year. 
Longevity noodles are another classic example, often appearing at celebratory meals. Longevity noodles, also known as long-life noodles or Yi Mein, refers to 长寿面 or 伊面 in Chinese. Essential for birthdays to wish for longevity, they are also a staple for Chinese New Year feasts in some communities, symbolizing good luck and prosperity  
So eating mud carp symbolizes a good relationship and fortune. The Chinese for “catfish” sounds like the word meaning “year plus”. So eating catfish is a wish for a surplus in the new year. Chinese people eat one fish on New Year’s Eve and one on New Year’s Day to symbolize a surplus year after year. 
On New Year’s Eve or Ōmisoka (大晦日), it is customary for the Japanese to reflect on the past year and usher in the coming year while enjoying a hot bowl of soba noodles called Toshikoshi Soba (年越し蕎麦), or year-crossing noodle. What better way to cross over a symbolic bridge than slurping up soba noodles? 
In the beginning, noodles were called “soup pancakes” (汤饼 / tang miàn). People would tear the dough into little pieces and throw them into the pot. It wasn’t until the Tang Dynasty when people began rolling them into the noodle shape we know today. For Chinese New Year, people like to eat long noodles. 
Just like dumplings, Mandarin oranges also resemble gold ingots, in both shape and colour, carrying a meaning of wealth. As 'orange' and 'success' sound similar in Mandarin, and one of the ways of writing tangerine includes the Chinese character for 'luck', eating or displaying Mandarin oranges or tangerines around the home is believed to bring good luck and fortune. 
What Is Chinese New Year? Many people think of the New Year as January 1st. On this day, people ditch their old calendars to bring about the 'new year,' as per the Gregorian calendar. However, unlike this New Year event of January 1st, the Chinese New Year has no defined date and usually falls between January 21st to February 20th, as per the  
In Chinese culture, noodles are more than just a staple food—they carry a special symbolic meaning, especially during celebrations. Longevity noodles, made with Yi Mein (伊面), are a classic dish served at birthdays, weddings, and festive occasions such as Chinese New Year.
