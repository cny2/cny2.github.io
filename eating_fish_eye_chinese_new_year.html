Most Americans consider January 1 the start of the new year, but many Asians and Asian-Americans don’t. Instead, they follow Lunar New Year, also referred to as Chinese New Year in the U.S., which begins on January 29, 2025. (That’s the Year of the Snake in the Chinese zodiac, BTW.) 
All over China, people have the tradition of having a lucky plate of fish on Spring Festival.

In the contemporary Chinese New Year celebrations, these customs have not only endured but also adapted to accommodate shifting dietary preferences, globalization, and the demands of modern life. </p>
