        <p>The stick result is analyzed by an interpreter, who has a book of Chinese poetic phrases and stories. The interpretation is generally short ranged, typically covering no more than one year, using Chinese New Year as the starting point. The interpreter typically charges a small fee. 
Brief History of Chinese Fortune Sticks . The fortune-telling method using the fortune sticks as a medium has been around since the times of ancient China, and more specifically since the Jin Dynasty (266-420 CE), as recorded in the Jade Box Records (Yu Xia Ji) 玉匣, the ancient Chinese book believed to be written Xu Xun, a famous Taoist monk in the 3rd-century CE. 
Numbers in Chinese characters are inscribed on the stick. They resemble a wide and modified version of incense sticks. The signature tube 签筒 Chien Tung, pronounced qiān tǒng, is a Chinese word that refers to a tube containing a sign for divination or gambling, a bamboo tube used to hold divination or gambling sticks. 
Chinese fortune-telling or “suan ming”—the calculation of fate—has many variations. Most of them originated in the I-Ching, or the Book of Changes. This was one of the oldest divination texts in China, dating back to 1,000 BC, and was a heavy influence by both Taoism and Confucian thinking. 
4) Fortune Sticks. This final popular way to have your fortune told is one that you're likely to come across at Taoist temples. Qiúqiān employs a bundle of sticks with different Chinese characters inscribed on them (32, 60, or 100 sticks). You shake the cylinder until a stick drops out with a Chinese character inscribed in it. 
In each year's Chinese New Year celebrations in Hong Kong, a member of the Hong Kong Government represents the city in a divination ritual called kau chim.The event takes place on the second day of the Lunar New Year at Che Kung temple, Sha Tin, where a fortune stick is drawn.

Kau Cim or Kau Chim is a fortune telling practice that is said to have been derived by the Yellow Emperor, the euhemerized founder of Chinese civilization, somewhere between the time he was teaching people how to build shelters, domesticate animals, and sow grain, and inventing Chinese Medicine, the bow sling, math, a calendar, a code of laws, the Chinese writing system, and a version of football. 
The oldest known method of fortune telling in the world is known as Kau Chime - a set of 78 numbered sticks held in a bamboo case. Holding the container in both hands and shaking it causes one of the sticks to rise and fall out. The number on the stick is cross referenced with ancient texts, and a fortune told. 
Kau Cim or Kau Chim is a fortune telling practice that originated in China in which the querent (person asking the question) requests answers from a sacred oracle lot. The practice is often performed in a Taoist or Buddhist temple in front of an altar. Kau Cim is often referred to as Chien Tung or Chinese Fortune Sticks by westerners. 
In honor of the Chinese New Year I am making a set of Chinese Fortune Sticks. Who doesn't love a fortune? Chinese Fortune Sticks are a fun take on the cookie. You have 50 numbered sticks. You draw a stick and read your corresponding fortune. If you have a party it is a fun conversation piece. Unlike cookies it can be left out and reused. 
A veteran actress, a Japanese actor and a Hong Kong teenager are among the worshippers who have flocked to one of the city’s largest Taoist temples on the eve of Lunar New Year to burn the first  
This method of fortune telling involves shaking a box full of bamboo sticks numbered 1 to 78 in such a manner that just one number would mysteriously jump out of the box. This number would then be your fortune and an interpreter would read it to you from his book.

The God of Wealth (财神) is one of the most revered deities in Chinese culture, symbolizing prosperity, abundance, and good fortune. Welcoming the God of Wealth during the Lunar New Year is a cherished tradition, believed to bring blessings and financial success for the year ahead. 
One good thing about ordering Chinese take-out for New Year's Eve the fortune cookie! Mine said: "You are unstoppable". I'll take that! Tess found these fabulous Chinese fortune sticks in a vintage store, and since the rest of us probably won't be as lucky, I bet they'd be fairly simple to make. 
Apart from Wong Tai Sin temple, many Hong Kong locals also visit Che Kung Temple in Sha Tin on the second and third day of Chinese New Year to worship, burn incense, draw fortune sticks, and turn the copper windmill (in a clockwise direction) to attract good luck.

When I was young, growing up in Hong Kong, the sight (and sound) of Chinese fortune sticks like these being used at temples was very familiar and exciting to me. Bundles of these sticks were placed in jars and gently shaken until a few sticks stuck out above the rest, or fell out. </p>
