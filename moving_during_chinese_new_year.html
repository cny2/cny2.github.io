        <p>1. Do choose an auspicious moving day: it is important to choose an auspicious day for moving into the new house. Cheng Day (''Cheng'' means accomplishing in everything), Horse Day (6th day of a lunar month), Ecliptic Day (a day good for everything) and San He Day (a triple harmony day) shall be selected as the lucky day for moving.

Here’s a list of 9 Chinese traditions when moving into a new home that die-hard believers will follow. Choose An Auspicious Day When Chinese people move to a new home, they first choose an  
8. Get Yourself New Cleaning Equipments Buy new brooms and mops. Because you are moving into a new space, you will not want to “sweep in your old troubles” with the broom from your last house. Do not place the old broom in the garage, either. Throw it away or leave it at the old house. Buy a new mop too. 
4. So, this whole thing about not moving or moving during Chinese New Year, frankly is not related to Feng Shui. It is related more to one's individual culture. 5.

It's believed that moving during this time may bring bad luck throughout the year. ‍ 3. Tomb-Sweeping Day 
Just like during Chinese New Year, placing symbols of prosperity around your house after moving in is said to increase wealth luck. Displaying lucky items, such as flowers and candy, will ‘sweeten’ your home's atmosphere while storing an ang pow (red packet) or two in your built-ins – especially the cabinets/drawers/safes that you use to  
Another Chinese ritual to follow when moving into your new house is to bring a kettle to boil water on your stove. According to Chinese customs, doing this ensures that your home is warm and gives you a leg up in your career. Afterwards, you can use the water to brew a Chinese tea pot. 4. Usher in wealth with sweets and red packets 
Placing luck-enhancing symbols all over your home after moving in is thought to boost wealth luck, just like during Chinese New Year. Displaying lucky objects like flowers and sweets may “sweeten” the ambiance in your home, and keeping a few ang pow (red packets) in your built-ins, especially in the safes and cupboards where you keep your valuables, is thought to bring luck. 
1. Wear something new as if it is the 1st lunar day of Chinese New Year. 2. Paste one pair of red 对联 (dui lian) Chinese scrolls on each side of the door. You can remove this after staying in your new house for 7 days. This is believed to ward off evil spirits 僻邪驱鬼. 3.
