        <p>The Vietnamese New Year celebration of Tet, short for Tet Nguyen Dan which means “festival of the first day”, is celebrated over three days as opposed to the traditional 15 of the Chinese New  
No Tết celebration is complete without a mention of the Vietnamese zodiac. Like its Chinese counterpart, the Vietnamese zodiac is a 12-year cycle where each year is associated with an animal. However, Vietnam adds its own unique twist to this tradition. The Rabbit is replaced by the Cat, believed to bring a sense of calmness and prosperity. 
Chinese New Year and the Vietnamese New Year (called Tết in Vietnam) actually have a lot in common. What we can be sure of is that Lunar New Year holidays are always about dedicating time for family, gatherings, gifts and hoping for the best for the New Year to come. 
Along with many other Asian countries, both the Chinese and the Vietnamese recognize the Lunar calendar as part of their cultural tradition. It's a calendar that incorporates a zodiac of twelve animals in rotation. As a new lunar new year begins, the "year" of a new animal also begins. On January 29, 2025, we will start the Year of the Snake. 
Tết is generally celebrated on the same day as Chinese New Year (also called Spring Festival), with the one-hour time difference between Vietnam and China resulting in the new moon occurring on different days.

The Tet festival was originally a three-day celebration, but it has gradually expanded to last up to two weeks. 
4. Vietnamese New Year Is Different from Chinese New Year. 5. Vietnamese New Year Is Celebrated Either in January or February. 6. Tet Celebrations Last Much Longer than the 7-Day Public Holiday. 7. Honoring Ong Tao Marks the Beginning of Vietnamese Lunar New Year. 8. Preparation for Lunar New Year Begins Weeks in Advance. 9. 
Lune New Year is primarily celebrated in many Asian cultures, including by Chinese, South Korean, Vietnamese, Singaporean, Malaysian, Filipino and Indonesian. Each culture has its own name for the  
Vietnamese New Year is celebrated on the same date as Chinese New Year. Both are based on the same lunisolar calendar. In 2025, it falls on Sunday January 29th. But Vietnamese people celebrate New Year with different customs, celebrations, and traditions from China. Read more on Vietnamese Lunar New Year and Chinese New Year vs Lunar New Year.
