        <p>The first day of Chinese New Year begins on the new moon that appears between January 21 and February 20. The seventh month of the lunar calendar is known as Ghost Month, per Chinese tradition. Some Chinese may avoid funerals or visits to a cemetery during those periods, so as not to attract spirits. If a loved one dies around the Chinese New  
Some of those Chinese New Year taboos will only sustain for first few days of the festival, while others may be kept till the Lantern Festival on the 15th day of the 1st lunar month, or even for a whole month. Hereunder are 16 things you should never do during the Chinese New Year. 
Chinese people believe that, as the Spring Festival is the start of a new year, what you do then will affect your luck in the coming year. There are many Chinese New Year traditions about dos and don'ts. Find out the top 18 things you should not do. Some are taboos on the first day of the Chinese New Year and some are superstitions for the  
Any Chinese customary weddings should be conducted within this period. After these 100 days, it is advisable to postpone the event till a year later. On the 100 th day, make an offering at the columbarium or grave site. 
Below is a list of dying Chinese New Year traditions: 1. Grave Visiting . According to Chinese beliefs, on the third day of the New Year evils spirits wander about the earth. It is thus considered a taboo to go out visiting friends and family. This is because these spirits can possess and cause you to bring misfortune to the people you are  
That explains why they are favored by the Chinese during the New Year celebrations. 3. Watch the CCTV Gala. It's not a Chinese New Year party without the CCTV Gala. The CCTV New Year’s Gala, also known as the Spring Festival Gala (春晚 Chūnwǎn), is a Chinese New Year special program. It is recognized as the world’s most-watched  
In Chinese culture, those who have lived at least 80 years are considered to have lived a full and long life. If you're attending a funeral service for someone over 80, you can typically expect the mood at the service to be celebratory rather than somber. Do share offerings in odd numbers. 
Today, families across the Chinese diaspora continue to reunite and pay respects at their ancestral graves during holidays like Chinese New Year and Qingming (Tomb Sweeping) Festival. When you have a chance to visit the grave of an immigrant Chinese ancestor, take photographs and pay close attention to their resting place. 
The traditional mourning period, called 守喪 (shǒusāng) is one year, and for the first-born son up to three years, though modern Chinese families observe a period of 49 days. During that time, the family prays for their loved one every week. Read about how you can support grieving family and friends. Before the funeral 
Let's delve into the numbers, particularly the surge in “dragon babies”. In 2024, during the Year of the Dragon, China witnessed a 5.7% year-on-year increase in births, with South Korea seeing a 3% rise. These spikes are noteworthy, considering both nations are grappling with declining birth rates. 
Postpone any events other than Chinese customary weddings until a year later. (Learn Chinese wedding traditions and makeup look here.) Refrain from conducting celebrations at home, including Chinese New Year and Chinese festival celebrations, before the 1st-year anniversary. 
Chinese New Year traditions regarding greeting are not like kissing, embrace, and handshaking in western countries. In the past, the first thing for a Chinese New Year visit started with kowtowing to the elders. No matter how old you are, if there is someone older than you, you need to kneel down to show respect and grateful feeling to the elders. 
It is not customary to visit during certain Jewish holidays, including Chanukah, and the intermediary days of Sukkot and Passover. Some also believe that Rosh Chodesh, the first day of any new month, is another day when you should likely avoid going to the gravesite, as this day is considered to be the celebration of the New Moon. 
Flock of people visiting Binondo during Chinese New Year . Binondo, the oldest Chinatown in the world, transforms into a living, breathing canvas of red and gold during Chinese New Year. Located in the heart of Manila, this historic district is the epicenter of Filipino-Chinese culture and the place to be for a truly immersive experience. 
11. Is it OK to accompany a friend to visit their family’s grave? Some people may get into a situation where they have to accompany their friend to visit the grave. It is better to keep some lucky items to ward off evil, such as a walnut bracelet and something jade. 12. Do not buy shoes during the Qingming Festival. 
Worshippers typically visit temples during the first three days of Chinese New Year to light incense, pray for blessings and wish for good luck and wealth in the year ahead. Hong Kong's Wong Tai Sin Temple is the city's largest and most popular temple, but while current rules advise us to stay home, you can try creating an at-home altar instead. 
Neihu is easy to get to from Taipei, but Dahu is a little more off the beaten track. If you plan to visit Dahu during Chinese New Year, you can expect crazy crowds and traffic, so try to carefully plan which day you visit. If you want to spend the night, nearby Tai’an Hot Spring has some great hotel spring hotels, but you’ll need to book early! 
This makes it the 15th day after the Spring Equinox, either 4, 5 or 6 April in a given year. [11] [12] [13] During Qingming, Chinese families visit the tombs of their ancestors to clean the gravesites and make ritual offerings to their ancestors.
