Although we celebrate Chinese New Year on 10 February according to the Gregorian calendar, li chun – which falls almost a week earlier – is the date in the lunar calendar that “officially” marks the start of spring.

In modern times, many practise depositing money into bank accounts on Li Chun, believing it brings them good fortune. 
This occasion is known as Li Chun (立春) to the Chinese – marking the beginning of Spring. This year, Li Chun starts on the 3rd of February and ends on the 18th of February. There is a belief that banking your money on the first day of Li Chun will boost your wealth and luck for the new year. 
Amidst the flurry of getting ready for the upcoming revelries – cleaning the house, buying new clothes, preparing the angpows – remember to also save the date for li chun, which falls on 4 February this year (almost two weeks after the first day of Chinese New Year)! 
Li Chun is a date on the Chinese calendar that marks the beginning of spring. It often falls around the same time as Chinese New Year, although the dates can vary — Chinese New Year might actually come before or after Li Chun. This year, Li Chun begins on 3 February 2025, at 10.10pm. 
As Chinese New Year approaches, many look to auspicious dates and times to attract good fortune. For business owners, choosing an auspicious time to start work is believed to bring extra luck throughout the year. Meanwhile, for the rest of us, selecting the right moments to deposit money can set the stage for a prosperous Year of the Snake.
