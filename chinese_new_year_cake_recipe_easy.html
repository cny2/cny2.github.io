BAKED CHINESE STICKY RICE CAKE (BAKED MOCHI CAKE) My life is seriously changed forever after I tried this baked nian gao. All these years, I’ve been making steamed nian gao and it’s a must in our house to celebrate Chinese New Year. The Chinese wants to start the year (nian) high (gao) 😉 I decided I need to try the baked version. 
Every year, Mama Lin makes a nian gao (年糕, neen go in Cantonese) for Lunar New Year. The character “年” means “year” and “糕” roughly translates to “cake.” Put together, 年糕 means new year’s cake. In Chinese culture, you eat dishes that carry auspicious meanings during new year celebrations. 
Allergy Friendly Steamed Rice Cake. I am excited to share this particular recipe because nian gao is vegan, gluten-free, and free of the top 9 allergens, whoo-hoo!. And I was thrilled to find out that my mom’s favorite sweet rice flour by Koda Farms. is produced in a rice only facility that is free of the top 8 allergens, gluten free, and GMO free. 
Then, they’ll visit markets, gather ingredients, and prepare for the big Reunion Dinner Celebration (Tuan Nian Fan 團年飯) that happens on the 30th day. </p>
