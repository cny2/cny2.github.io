1. It's a tradition to put crisp, new bills inside a Chinese New Year red envelope. Giving dirty or wrinkled bills is in bad taste. In the week leading up to Chinese New Year, many people stand in long queues at banks to exchange old bills for new ones. 2. You're supposed to avoid putting coins in the envelopes. 3. 
Once a year, it would come out of the forest at night and devour entire villages. The steps of protection against Nian during New Year’s Eve transformed into the Spring Festival celebration. Parents would also give children money that night. This way, the children would have something to bribe the monster or other evil spirits with.

Red envelopes, also called red packets, lucky money, or hongbao in Chinese, are a popular monetary gift given on some important occasions or festivals in China and some other Asian countries, especially widely seen during the Chinese New Year (Spring Festival). It is a Chinese New Year gift with money stuffed into red paper to kids. 
A red envelope at Chinese New Year takes the place of the Christmas bonus common in Western workplaces. Given the expense of traveling home for the holiday, many employers give their employees a red envelope filled with the equivalent of a month’s pay at the beginning of the festival, along with a smaller “token of red” when they return  
Chinese New Year Red Envelopes. Lunar New Year red envelopes, also known as 'hongbao' or 'laisee' are a tradition that symbolises the giving of good luck, prosperity, and blessings for the coming year. Typically filled with money, these vibrant red packets are shared among family members, friends, and co-workers to spread joy and good fortune. 
For anyone who has felt awkward at Chinese New Year, here’s a simple guide to navigating the social minefield of red envelopes – condensed into eight simple rules. 1. You give out red envelopes if you’re married. Don’t commit the classic faux-pas of handing out one red envelope from the two of you. Both spouses give a red envelope each. 2. 
Unsurprising of a story so old, alternative origins exist, including one version of the legend that includes sealing money in red paper. But the earliest examples of mass-produced envelopes today synonymous with Chinese New Year appear to be from 1961, produced by Wells Fargo. 
It’s traditional to leave a red envelope with two tangerines (leaves on, of course) by a child’s bedside on New Year’s Eve. Given that Chinese New Year isn’t celebrated with material gifts, the amount is usually around $20, enough for the child to buy a toy on his or her own. 
Chinese New Year is a time of celebration, family gatherings, and rich traditions, and one of the most cherished customs is giving red envelopes, or hongbao (红包). These bright red packets are filled with money and given to children, loved ones, and even colleagues as a symbol of good luck and blessings for the year ahead. 
However, unlike the red envelopes used in Chinese culture, the money in Korea can be presented in white envelopes, as whiteness in Korean culture symbolises purity and new beginnings. 
1 The custom of giving red envelopes originates in some of the oldest stories of Chinese New Year. As the legend goes, a demon known as 'Sui' terrorized children while they slept on New Year’s Eve, and parents would try to keep their children awake all night to protect them.
