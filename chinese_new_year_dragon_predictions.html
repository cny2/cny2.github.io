2024 is the Year of the Wood Dragon, beginning on February 10th, 2024 (Chinese New Year) and concluding on January 28th, 2025 (Chinese New Year's Eve). In Chinese culture, the Dragon holds a significant place as an auspicious and extraordinary creature, unparalleled in talent and excellence. It symbolizes power, nobility, honor, luck, and success. 
In 2025, the fortune of people born in the Year of the Dragon in love is also relatively smooth, which is conducive to developing new relationships or deepening existing relationships. The influence of lucky stars may contribute to the harmony of their emotional life, but they should also pay attention to communication and understanding to  
In Chinese culture, the Dragon is the only mythical sign in the zodiac and is associated with ambition, honor, and success. However, in 2025, the wise Wood Snake whispers not to rush things, but to make well-thought-out decisions. Let’s see how this year will unfold for you, my dear Dragons! 
In Chinese astrology, horoscopes and monthly predictions are based on the lunar calendar, running from Chinese New Year's Day to the eve of the next New Year.

2024 is the Year of the Wood Dragon. Dragon is the 5th animal in the 12-year cycle of the Chinese zodiac signs, coming after the Rabbit and before the Snake.

You’ll want to hang in there even so, Dragon, as this isn’t the best job-hunting year. You’ll need a steady paycheck to weather the storms of 2024, and new positions won’t be easy to find. Those in business for themselves may face heavy losses this year, even having to close shop—at least temporarily—in the worst-case scenario.

This year, the Chinese New Year (and the Year of the Dragon) starts on Feb. 10, 2024, and ends on Jan. 28, 2025. Also worth noting: Dragons aren’t the only lucky thing about 2024. 
But before we dive into that, let’s talk about the Chinese New Year. The Year of the Wood Snake is 2025, and it seems to be an excellent year for a lot of people. On January 29, 2025, the Chinese New Year will begin this year, and it will end on February 16, 2026.
