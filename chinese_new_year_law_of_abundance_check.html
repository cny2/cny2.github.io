5. Wearing new clothes and wishing others good luck. On New Year’s Day, wearing new clothes symbolizes a fresh start. Wearing red is believed to attract luck and prosperity. Greeting others “gongxi” or best wishes is thought to usher in an auspicious year. 
The law of abundance is a Chinese tradition that theoretically helps a person to prosper financially. It is a concept where a person visualizes a goal and acts out the goal by physically writing out a blank check.
