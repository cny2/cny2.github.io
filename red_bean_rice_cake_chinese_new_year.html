        <h2><strong>red bean rice cake chinese new year curry chinese new year shirt</strong></h2>
        <p>The most popular type of rice cake is made with glutinous rice flour and brown sugar. They are often steamed with red beans, dates, nuts or taro. This type of rice cake is considered traditional Chinese Nian Gao. The rice cake is steamed, sliced into pieces, dipped in beaten eggs then pan fried on both sides. 
Nian Gao Recipe Instructions. Prepare two 8-inch round baking pans by brushing the insides with vegetable oil.. Add 2 cups of water and the ginger to a medium-sized pot, bring it a boil, then let it simmer for 10 minutes over low to medium heat with the lid covered. 
3. Make Nian Gao batter. 4. Make red bean paste filling.Add 1/2 cup of Nian Gao batter to the red bean paste. The texture will become more fluffy and easy to spread. 
The past several years, I have tried at least one new sticky rice recipe from my mom’s collection for Chinese New Year. This year, I made this Red Bean Sticky Rice Cake and my Auntie Florences’ Jujube Date Sticky Rice Cake. I sent a sample of each to my mom for Chinese New Year so she could sample them. She loves sticky rice cake but doesn  
Everything on the Chinese new year dinner table has a meaning. This rice cake is called “Nian Gao”(年糕) in Chinese, which literally translates into “Year Cake”. It is essential during Chinese new year because cake in Chinese-“Gao”(糕), sounds like “high”(高) in Mandarin. Nian Gao- higher and better every year! 
Steps: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. As with most easy baked goods, pour all the ingredients in a large bowl and mix until smooth. Spray oil onto a baking pan and pour your mixture in. 
Baked nian gao is a surprisingly easy Chinese glutinous rice cake dessert that is chewy, lightly sweetened, and has a lightly crusty coconut top! The soft red bean paste filling adds an extra delicious layer. Baked nian gao (烤年糕) is a classic Chinese new year rice cake dessert. It is extremely quick and easy and quickly makes a large batch, 
Then, I found a children's book in the library, a Chinese version of The Gingerbread Man, which included a recipe for a baked Nian Gao with a red bean paste layer sandwiched inside the rice cake. Intrigued by this, I gave it a try and brought it to my young son’s class for a Lunar New Year celebration. 
Cut the dough into 6 even small pieces and roll them into small, flat circles. Put the red bean filling into the center of the dough skin, about 1 tablespoon of filling. 
Grease the bottom and the side of a 7 or 8-inch round pan. 7-inch pan will yield a bit taller cake. Pour half of the batter into the pan and then use a spoon to top with 3/4 of the red beans. 
Happy Chinese New Year! OK, so I am a bit late on this post, but since the Chinese New Year celebrations usually last several days, I’m technically still good. 2014 marks the year of the horse and I thought that I’d ring in the new year with some red bean sticky cake, which is pronounced nián gāo (年糕). 
Sticky rice is considered good luck for Chinese New Year because it’s symbolic of family cohesiveness, and it’s Chinese characters sound like “getting higher with each year,” implying prosperity in business, better grades, and promotions. 
Watch Daddy Lau teach us how to make nian gao with red bean, also known as nìhn gōu or Chinese New Year Cake. This video includes our family's nian gao recip 
Glutinous rice flour (Nuo Mi Fen/糯米粉). The most important ingredient of Nian Gao, it’s made of finely ground glutinous rice (aka sweet white rice). It’s characterised by its sticky, stretchy nature once cooked, thus the name. 
Chinese New Year Cake with Palm Sugar and Sweetened Red BeansIngredients: （6 inch cake mold)150g Palm sugar (can be replaced by brown sugar or white sugar)2 
Red Bean Cake (紅豆糕) actually refers to two different dishes. One of them is a summer sweet treat made of red beans (aka Azuki Beans) and coconut milk with jelly-like consistency; the other one is the traditional steamed red bean rice cake made during Chinese New Year and exchanged between families and relatives. In creating today’s dish  
Niangao literally means "year cake", but nian is a homonym for sticky, hence the use of sticky or glutinous rice in this recipe, and gao is a homonym for high, so niangao sounds like "year high" and is supposed to bring luck by symbolising achieving new heights in the coming year. 
During the busy Chinese New Year’s celebration week, we have lots of different cakes (gao 糕). Yes, we can’t celebrate without all the traditional cakes, radish cake, taro cake (aka yum cake), sticky rice cake and water chestnut cake. 
BAKED CHINESE STICKY RICE CAKE (BAKED MOCHI CAKE) My life is seriously changed forever after I tried this baked nian gao. All these years, I’ve been making steamed nian gao and it’s a must in our house to celebrate Chinese New Year. The Chinese wants to start the year (nian) high (gao) 😉 I decided I need to try the baked version.

Baked: the steaming method is traditional when making Chinese New Year Cake but can take up to 20 hours in a bamboo steamer!
