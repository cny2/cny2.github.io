        <p>The Vietnamese New Year celebration of Tet, short for Tet Nguyen Dan which means “festival of the first day”, is celebrated over three days as opposed to the traditional 15 of the Chinese New  
No Tết celebration is complete without a mention of the Vietnamese zodiac. Like its Chinese counterpart, the Vietnamese zodiac is a 12-year cycle where each year is associated with an animal. However, Vietnam adds its own unique twist to this tradition. The Rabbit is replaced by the Cat, believed to bring a sense of calmness and prosperity. 
Vietnamese New Year, known as Tết Nguyên Đán or simply Tết, has its roots in ancient Vietnamese agrarian traditions and the lunar calendar, influenced by Chinese culture. Dating back over 2,000 years, Tết originally marked the beginning of the farming cycle, celebrating the arrival of spring and paying respect to ancestors and deities. 
While similar to the Chinese Lunar New Year, Tết has distinct traditions and cultural significance unique to Vietnam. The holiday’s origins date back to the 18th century B.C., influenced by Chinese culture, though it has evolved over centuries to reflect Vietnam’s unique customs.

The Tet festival was originally a three-day celebration, but it has gradually expanded to last up to two weeks. 
Rarely, the dates of Vietnamese and Chinese Lunar New Year can differ as such in 1943, when Vietnam celebrated Lunar New Year, one month after China. It takes place from the first day of the first month of the Vietnamese lunar calendar (around late January or early February) until at least the third day. 
Along with many other Asian countries, both the Chinese and the Vietnamese recognize the Lunar calendar as part of their cultural tradition. It's a calendar that incorporates a zodiac of twelve animals in rotation. As a new lunar new year begins, the "year" of a new animal also begins.

Tet celebrations can range from 3 days and continue for up to one week. The festival is split into the day before New Year's Eve, New Year's Eve, and New Year's Day. All of these days correspond to the Vietnamese or lunar calendar, so they will happen on a different date every year. Tet Festival falls on January 29th in 2025. 
The Tet holiday is all about starting afresh, forgetting about the past, and settling your debts and disputes. Just like the western new year, the aim is to set the tone, and there are many ways to do that in Vietnam. This time of year, from gift-giving to spring cleaning, cooking, and visiting friends and families, is busy. Lucky money
