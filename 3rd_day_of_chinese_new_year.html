Chinese New Year, the grandest festival for Chinese people, is celebrated for more than half a month. According to the oldest traditions, people follow a day-by-day schedule of Chinese New Year festivities from the 23rd day of the 12th lunar month, with specific things to do on certain days. 
The public holiday lasts from January 28th to February 3rd, during which the New Year's Eve on January 28th and the New Year's Day on January 29th are the peak time of celebration. The commonly known New Year calendar counts from the New Year's Eve to the Lantern Festival on February 12th 2025. 
On the third day of Chinese New Year, known as 初三, it is referred to as 赤口/赤狗, translating to the day of red mouths or red dogs. Traditionally, people tend to stay indoors on this day because the red mouths signify a heightened likelihood of encountering conflicts and arguments with others. 
The third Day of 2025 Chinese New Year is the Mice Wedding Day, Friday, January 31, 2025. It is also called the Chinese New Year Red-Dog Day. January 31, 2025 is the birthday of Pig.

As the Lunar New Year unfolds, the third day, known as "Chor 3" in Cantonese dialect, carries its own significance in the tapestry of Chinese New Year traditions.

Fourth Day of Chinese New Year 初四. The day to honour the Kitchen god who would return to Heaven to report on the family to the Jade Emperor, some place nian2 gao1 (New Year Sticky Cake) as offerings to appease the Kitchen god who then either can’t speak much due to the stickiness of the sweet cake or speaks sweet nothings about the family.
