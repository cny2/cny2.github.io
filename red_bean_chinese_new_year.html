Watch Daddy Lau teach us how to make nian gao with red bean, also known as nìhn gōu or Chinese New Year Cake. This video includes our family's nian gao recip 
Unlike the typical New Year’s cake, her version is made with Coconut Milk and a delicious layer of red bean filling in the middle. Mrs. Leong’s recipe carries a long and notable history. Essentially, it remains true to its originator: an Admiral’s daughter born in China during the late 1800’s. 
Happy Chinese New Year! OK, so I am a bit late on this post, but since the Chinese New Year celebrations usually last several days, I’m technically still good. 2014 marks the year of the horse and I thought that I’d ring in the new year with some red bean sticky cake, which is pronounced nián gāo (年糕). 
The flavor is like no other beans, commonly paired with sticky rice byproduct. For some reason, the flavor of red bean paired with sticky rice has become something irresistible for Asians. Nian Gao with azuki bean is especially popular during Chinese new year since red symbolizes good luck! 
Drain the beans and discard the water. In a saucepan, add the soaked beans, 3 cups of fresh water, and sugar. Bring the water to a vigorous boil over high heat before lowering the heat to medium-low to maintain a gentle simmer. Cover and cook for 2 hours while occasionally checking to replenish with water 
Baked nian gao is a surprisingly easy Chinese glutinous rice cake dessert that is chewy, lightly sweetened, and has a lightly crusty coconut top! The soft red bean paste filling adds an extra delicious layer. Baked nian gao (烤年糕) is a classic Chinese new year rice cake dessert. It is extremely quick and easy and quickly makes a large  
Then, I found a children's book in the library, a Chinese version of The Gingerbread Man, which included a recipe for a baked Nian Gao with a red bean paste layer sandwiched inside the rice cake. Intrigued by this, I gave it a try and brought it to my young son’s class for a Lunar New Year celebration. 
Red Bean Sticky Rice Cake is a traditional sweet enjoyed during Chinese New Year. Adzuki beans add texture to this soft, sticky rice cake. This is one of many sticky rice recipes my mom has collected over the years. I have a black binder full of her favorite recipes, and I have sectioned off a tab with all her favorite sticky rice recipes.

Lightly grease a rectangular 9 x 13in (23 x 33cm) baking pan and  
My sesame balls recipe uses store-bought red bean paste. Either the fine paste or the chunky type works, but the fine bean paste is easier to work with. Make sure the main ingredients only contain red bean, sugar and water. Some Chinese brands of red bean paste contain maltose. That type is designed for making mooncakes and is very sticky. 
Red Bean Cake is traditionally a popular dessert served during Chinese New Year celebration! It is slightly sweet and the red bean flavor is plentiful! In 
Sticky rice is considered good luck for Chinese New Year because it’s symbolic of family cohesiveness, and it’s Chinese characters sound like “getting higher with each year,” implying prosperity in business, better grades, and promotions. 
2. Sesame Seed Balls . Sesame seed balls, or jian dui, are a popular dessert in China and Taiwan. Sold both in streets and dim sum restaurants, these ubiquitous treats are beloved by everyone. 
During the busy Chinese New Year’s celebration week, we have lots of different cakes (gao 糕). Yes, we can’t celebrate without all the traditional cakes, radish cake, taro cake (aka yum cake), sticky rice cake and water chestnut cake. 
Although they’re enjoyed all year round, as breakfast, snack or dinner staple, for me red bean buns are always associated with Chinese New Year. In northern Chinese households like my family, cooking a big batch of Mantou (plain steam buns) and red bean buns is a ritual of New Year preparation. 
The Coconut and Red Bean Chinese New Year Rice Cake is an exciting twist on tradition, with layers of coconut and red bean bringing a rich flavor profile to the chewy rice base. This unique rice cake offers a delightful texture and a sweet surprise in every bite, making it a crowd-pleaser during festive gatherings. 
Drain the red beans and put into a saucepan. Add 750ml of water into the sauce pan and boil it first. Once it has reached boiling point reduce the heat and simmer for around 1 hour until the red beans are soft enough that you can squash them with your fingers. 
Chinese New Year Cake with Palm Sugar and Sweetened Red BeansIngredients: （6 inch cake mold)150g Palm sugar (can be replaced by brown sugar or white sugar)2 
Marinate the Beef: In a bowl, combine the beef slices with soy sauce, hoisin sauce, and Shaoxing wine. Let it marinate for 20 minutes. Prepare the Noodles: Cook the Chinese wheat noodles according to the package instructions. </p>
