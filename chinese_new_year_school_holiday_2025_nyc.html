        <p>It's the first time New York students will have the day off for the Lunar New Year since a new state law was signed in 2023. In 2024, the holiday fell on a Saturday. 
This year marks the first time a new school holiday is officially observed in New York state. Wednesday, Jan. 29, 2025, is Lunar New Year, also known as Chinese New Year. It’s considered to be  
Wednesday, Jan. 29 may not be a federal holiday, but the day — Asian Lunar New Year — is a New York public school holiday. The one-day observance — which varies each year and typically comes  
The holiday fell on a weekend in 2024, so schools weren't in session, making 2025 the first year that schools close statewide for the occasion. Zoom in: New York's legislation was passed in the wake of rising anti-Asian hate in the U.S., per members of its state legislature. 
New York State is ringing in 2025 with a brand-new school holiday: Lunar New Year. For the first time, public schools across the state will close on Wednesday, January 29, to celebrate. What is Lunar New Year? Lunar New Year, also known as Chinese New Year, marks the beginning of a new year based on the lunar calendar. 
NYC schools are closed for Lunar New Year but it's not a federal holiday so banks and the US stock markets stay open.  In the Chinese zodiac, 2025 is the Year of the Snake. Different countries  
Public schools across New York State will close Wednesday to mark Asian Lunar New Year, officially recognized as a school holiday for the first time.. Governor Kathy Hochul signed the legislation in September 2023, highlighting the holiday as a celebration of the state’s growing diversity and the contributions of the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community. 
Public schools will be closed on Wednesday, Jan. 29, in observance of Lunar New Year, according to the city Department of Education academic calendar for the 2024-2025 school year. 
Governor Kathy Hochul today signed legislation to declare Asian Lunar New Year a public school holiday across New York State.

The Lunar New Year, widely celebrated in Asia and the United States, kicks off on January 29, 2025, marking the Year of the Snake. New York State will officially observe it as a public school holiday. 
The holiday is a fifteen-day celebration, according to the National Museum of Asian Art, with the final day of the holiday being the Lantern Festival (Feb. 12, 2025). 
In 2023, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul declared the Lunar New Year a public school holiday across the Empire State.. The Lunar New Year happens on the second new moon after the December 21st winter solstice.
