        <p>Every year, the Lunar New Year marks the transition from one animal to another. The Year of the Dragon, which began on Feb. 10, 2024, ended Tuesday to begin the Year of the Snake. 
Simply put, Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year are not the same. Despite being related, there are a few noteworthy differences between the two. Read on to find out what they are. The Differences between Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year 1. "Chinese New Year" is specific while "Lunar New Year" is more general. 
The holiday is sometimes called the Lunar New Year because the dates of celebration follow the phases of the moon. Since the mid-1990s people in China have been given seven consecutive days off work during the Chinese New Year. 
The festival is also called "Lunar New Year" in English, despite the traditional Chinese calendar being lunisolar and not lunar. However, "Chinese New Year" is still a commonly-used translation for people of non-Chinese backgrounds. [20] 
For Chinese people, Lunar New Year is the Spring Festival,  In Korea, the Lunar New Year is called Seollal; in Vietnam, Tet; and in Tibet, Losar. (Related: See Hong Kong like a Nat Geo Explorer.)

Lunar New Year, festival typically celebrated in China and other Asian countries that begins with the first new moon of the lunar calendar and ends on the first full moon of the lunar calendar, 15 days later. The dates of the holiday vary from year to year, beginning some time between January 21 and February 20.

In China, Lunar New Year is called "Chūnjié"(chwnn-jyeah) or Spring Festival. Legend says that the Nian ("Year") monster attacked villagers at the beginning of every new year. Because the
