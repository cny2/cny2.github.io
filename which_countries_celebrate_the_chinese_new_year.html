In diaspora communities, particularly in cultural enclaves, Lunar New Year is visibly and joyfully celebrated. In the Chinese zodiac, 2025 is the Year of the Snake. Different countries across Asia celebrate the new year in many ways and may follow a different zodiac. What is the Lunar New Year? 
Many of us aren't even aware of what countries celebrate the Lunar New Year. The Lunar New Year is based on the Chinese Lunar calendar, which runs approximately one to two months behind our calendar. It is also of little surprise that most of the countries that adhere to the Lunar calendar are also Asian in origin. 
Lunar New Year is the beginning of a new year based on lunar calendars or, informally but more widely, lunisolar calendars.Typically, both types of calendar begin with a new moon but, whilst a lunar calendar year has a fixed number (usually twelve) lunar months, lunisolar calendars have a variable number of lunar months, resetting the count periodically to resynchronise with the solar year. 
For around 1.4 billion Chinese, the new year begins on February 10 - unlike in the Gregorian calendar, China calculates its traditional new year's date according to the lunar cycle. 
There’s no shortage of ways to celebrate Lunar New Year in New York. Here are a few to look forward to: The Ace Hotel in Downtown Brooklyn is celebrating the Year of the Snake starting at 7.pm. on January 31, with a DJ, saxophonists, mah-jongg, Chinese New Year bites, and a mask-making station. 
Southeast Asian countries with a significant Chinese population celebrate Chinese New Year with similar traditions. Singapore and Malaysia observe a 2-day holiday from January 29th to 30th in 2025. Indonesia has a day public holiday on January 29th, 2025.

Lunar New Year marks the beginning of a new year on China's traditional lunisolar calendar. It is a time for family gatherings. It is the most important festival in China (where it is known as Chinese New Year or Spring Festival), and it is also widely celebrated in South Korea (where it is known as Seollal), in Vietnam (as Tet), as well as Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, and other countries

In Vietnam, the lunar calendar is also widely used, and the festival time is the same with China. Unlike the festival is celebrated only in Chinese quarters of western countries, Lunar New Year, called Tet in Vietnamese, has developed into a national holiday for all the citizens. The customs of celebration varies a lot from China. 
Since the mid-1990s people in China have been given seven consecutive days off work during the Chinese New Year.
