        <p>According to Chinese mythology, the nian lives under the sea or in the mountains. The Chinese character nian more usually means "year" or "new year". The earliest written sources that refer to the nian as a creature date to the early 20th century. 
According to the ancient Chinese legend, in ancient time, there was a ferocious monster named “Nian” with sharp teeth and horns. Secluding itself in the dark sea for a long time, the beast would go onshore by the end of the lunar year and hunt people and livestock. 
Nian, a mythical beast in Chinese folklore, holds a significant place in the cultural tapestry of China. With its fearsome reputation, Nian is not just a creature of terror but is intricately linked to the celebration of the Lunar New Year. 
The character 年 (Nián) could mean a 'year' or 'the monster Nian'. In ancient times, there was a monster named Nian (年, or Nianshou 年兽) with a long head and sharp horns. It dwelled deep in the sea all year round and only showed up every New Year's Eve to eat people and livestock in nearby villages. 
The Nian (年) is a mythical creature in Chinese folklore, best known for its association with the origins of Chinese New Year traditions. According to legend, the Nian is a fierce beast that terrorized villages at the end of each lunar year, prompting the development of rituals and celebrations to ward it off.

Have you ever wondered why Chinese people display red items and set off fireworks during the Chinese New Year? Long, long ago in ancient China, there was a fierce beast called “Nian”. Its head looked like a lion with a sharp horn on it which could be used to attack its prey. 
The first and most well known is the legend of Nian (Year “Nian” as in New Year –”Xin Nian”). There are two versions of the legend of Nian, both include a scary beast with characteristics of a lion, ox, and unicorn, that had a dragon like appearance.
