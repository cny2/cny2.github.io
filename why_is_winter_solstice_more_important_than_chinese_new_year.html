        <h2><strong>why is winter solstice more important than chinese new year chinese new year northbridge 2025</strong></h2>
        <p>The ancients also used the winter solstice to judge the weather in the coming year. If the day of the winter solstice is bright and sunny, it means the day that Chinese New Year arrives on will be cloudy. Therefore, the ancient Chinese believe the Winter Solstice festival is more important than Chinese New Year. 
There is an old saying that Dongzhi (/dong-jrr/ 'the Winter Solstice') is more important than Chinese Lunar New Year. Dongzhi has an important place in the traditional festivals of China. It is usually celebrated on December 20th or 21st, when the night is longest and the day is shortest in the northern hemisphere. 
Lunar New Year is one of the most celebrated festivals in China but, in Chinese culture, the winter solstice, or dongzhi, is seen as the more important one; We break down why that is the case  
Today, it is one of the most significant Chinese festivals. There’s even a saying in Chinese tradition that says that the Winter Solstice is more important than the Lunar New Year! Though prominently celebrated during the Han Dynasty, it was during the Tang (618 – 907 AD) and Song Dynasty (960 – 1279 AD) that the festival truly prospered. 
In Chinese tradition, there’s a saying that says Winter Solstice is more important than the Lunar New Year. That is because ancient China was an agricultural community , and cultivation had to be done according to the season. 
The Role of Winter Solstice in Chinese Philosophy. The Winter Solstice is deeply tied to Chinese philosophical beliefs, particularly 道教 (dào jiào, Taoism) and 儒家思想 (rú jiā sī xiǎng, Confucianism). It embodies the balance of yin and yang, emphasizing harmony between humans and nature. 1. Yin-Yang Theory 
In China, it is called Dongzhi, a traditional festival once as important as Chinese New Year. Why is the Winter Solstice so important in China? The ancients believed that the Donzhi was a lucky day since when the sun became more and more active, indicating the terrible past was gone and another new year full of hope was coming. 
When is Winter Solstice in China this year? Winter Solstice in China typically falls between 21 st and 23 rd In 2024, it will be celebrated on Saturday 21 st December. Is Winter Solstice as important as Chinese New Year in Chinese culture? Historically, Winter Solstice was as important, if not more important, than Chinese New Year in Chinese  
Much like in other cultures around the world, the Chinese Winter Solstice Festival was regarded as an extremely important time and a major holiday in China. In fact, there is a traditional saying: “冬至大如年” (Dōngzhì dà rúnián) which roughly translates to “the winter solstice is as important as the Chinese New Year.” 
The Winter Solstice, dongzhi in Mandarin, is the day with the shortest period of daylight, either December 21 or 22 of the year. Winter Solstice (冬至) is commonly regarded as one of the most important Chinese festivals. The dongzhi festival has been celebrated for over 2,000 years and is usually a time for family gatherings and eating tangyuan. 
Why the Winter Solstice is More Important than Chinese New Year When I was a kid, my mom told me that back in the old country (the old country being Taishan, China) that there was a saying among the people that 冬大过年 (or winter is bigger/greater than year). 
GEORGE TOWN: Some Malaysian Chinese families here believe that the Winter Solstice Festival (or Dong Zhi) is more important than the Chinese New Year. 
It’s hard for the modern mind to imagine spending 30 years building something to celebrate a three-day event. Yet, that’s how important the Winter Solstice was to the ancients.There are still traditional cultures around the world today that believe that the ceremonies they conduct on a daily, monthly and yearly basis keep the earth spinning on its axis. 
As other cultures adopted this calendar they didn't all adopt the same start date for the year. For example Anglo-Saxons that had adopted the Julian calendar tended to go with the winter solstice on 25 December as the New Year (lining up with their pre-Christian traditions), but some used the spring equinox of 25 March, others even 24 September. 
In Chinese tradition, there’s a saying that says Winter Solstice is more important than the Lunar New Year. That is because ancient China was an agricultural community , and cultivation had to be done according to the season. 
For most native folks, winter solstice is more important than Lunar New Year because it’s the shortest and coldest day of the year. Akin to Chinese Thanksgiving, it becomes a Chinese tradition to gather the family around a warm dinner to nurture the soul with celebration, and the body with good food to fight the remaining winter. 
The Winter Solstice, or "Dongzhi" (冬至), is one of the most significant solar terms in the Chinese lunar calendar and holds a special place in Chinese tradition. As the day with the shortest daylight and the longest night of the year in the northern hemisphere, Winter Solstice marks the shift toward longer days and the return of warmth. 
When is Chinese New Year? The date of the Chinese New Year is determined by the traditional Chinese calendar, a lunisolar calendar that blends solar, lunar, and other cycles. The holiday falls on the second new moon after the winter solstice on December 21. Each year the New Year in China falls on a different date than on the Gregorian calendar. 
To understand why that is so, it is necessary to examine the “24 solar terms”, a system unique to Chinese culture. This ancient way to mark the seasons is still celebrated in Hong Kong, with days such as Ching Ming – also known as “grave sweeping” day. Many companies allow their employees to leave work early for the winter solstice. 
It is rooted in the principles of the Chinese cosmology and the yin-yang philosophy. The Winter Solstice represents the rebirth of yang energy, as days gradually become longer after this point, signifying hope and renewal. In ancient times, the Winter Solstice was regarded as the start of a new year. </p>
