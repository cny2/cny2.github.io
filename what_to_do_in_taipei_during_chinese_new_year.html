        <p>Like most department stores in Taipei, Taipei 101 Shopping Center (including Taipei 101 Observatory!) will usually remains open every day of Chinese New Year. On New Year’s Eve (Jan 28 in 2025), the Taipei 101 Shipping Center hours are usually reduced to 11 AM to 6 PM (instead of the usual 11 AM to 9:30 PM). 
Lunar New Year Lion Dances in Taipei. There are several famous Chinese New Year / Lunar New Year dances in Taipei in 2025. Grand Hyatt Taipei Lion Dance / Dragon Dance. 29 January 2025. Celebrate the Taiwan Lunar New Year at the Taipei Grand Hyatt with a spectacular lion and dragon dance in the foyer between 11am and 1.30pm with a huge drum  
In terms of restaurants in Taipei during Chinese New Year, most really do close for New Year’s Eve and the first 2-3 days of the New Year. If you look hard enough, though, you can still find a few open, including most fast food chains. You may also have better luck trying more international or foreign-run places. 
As well as the temples being awash with red lanterns and the constant smoke and bangs of fire-crackers being set off, one of the best places to visit for Lunar New Year is Dihua Street (迪化街) in southern Taipei. During Lunar New Year in Taipei during January 2025, this is very much THE place for local people to do all their pre Lunar New  
As the capital city of the nation, Taipei City has the most notable New Year’s Eve Countdown Party, which is usually held in Taipei City Hall Square and is dubbed as one of the most fabulous activities you can join after drafting your New Year’s resolutions. This annual event continually highlights the most popular pop stars compared to the  
Taipei Lunar New Year Festival 2025. 29 January 2025. Lunar New Year in Taiwan / Taipei in 2025 begins from 29 January 2025 – Taiwan’s temples come alive with celebrations and many Taiwanese and tourists from overseas escape their home cities to take breaks in Taiwan holiday hotspots like Sun Moon Lake and Alishan. 
Chinese New Year is the most popular festival in Taiwan, and here in Taipei, there are plenty of ways to spend the holiday. From taking in the sights to enjoying some tasty traditional foods, there’s never a dull moment for tourists during Chinese New Year. 
Top Destinations to Experience Chinese New Year in Taiwan Taipei. Taipei, the capital city, is a hub of activity during the Chinese New Year. Visit the Longshan Temple to witness traditional rituals and enjoy the festive atmosphere at the Dihua Street Market, where you can shop for New Year goodies and souvenirs. 
Chinese New Year in Taiwan is a time for family reunions, honoring ancestors, and celebrating new beginnings. The festivities typically last for 15 days, culminating in the Lantern Festival. During this period, the island comes alive with vibrant decorations, traditional music, and the tantalizing aroma of festive foods. 
With this year’s Lunar New Year holiday being nine days — from Jan. 25 to Feb. 2 — Taipei and New Taipei City’s travel departments have recommended a number of tourist attractions to visit during the holiday, from museums and special exhibitions to scenic sites and hot springs. The Taipei  
Taiwan CNY holidays will be from 8 Feb 2024 till 14 Feb 2024 . 9 Feb 2024 is Chinese New Year’s eve. Restaurants will be closed. 
Part of the reason is that January is kind of a lull between Christmas/New Year’s Eve celebrations in December, and the traditional Lunar New Year holiday, which often takes place in February. In 2025, Lunar New Year will come at the end of January (Jan. 29, national holidays from Jan 27 to Feb 2). 
In 2025, Lunar New Year’s Day falls on January 29 and the holiday will last from January 25 to February 2. This will not be an ideal time to visit. For the best information about this, see my guide to planning a trip to Taiwan during Chinese New Year and what will be open/closed in Taipei at this time. 
There are lots of shops selling red envelopes and spring couplets in new year markets during Lunar new year.

Xinyi district is a popular district for anyone looking to experience the New Year vibe. Just adjacent to Taipei 101, the Xinyi District is decorated with many festive celebrations on New Year’s Eve. The streets are lined with glittery lights, street music performances, and even amazing New Year’s activities. 
While Taipei is generally a bad place for budget travelers, in the weeks leading up to Chinese New Year, the collective spirit of one market street in particular becomes generous indeed. Tihua street is Taipei's most famous gift street, a great place to buy seasonal gifts like lung-sized chunks of pressed fish roe and vacuum packed bags of  
If you happen to be visiting Taipei during Chinese New Year, you can’t miss the city’s best event, the dragon and lion dance performance held in the magnificent lobby of Grant Hyatt Taipei. While you’re there, consider dining at the Grand Hyatt Buffet Restaurant . 
This is because the city council lays on a free New Year’s Eve Party just in front of the hall featuring Taiwanese singers. Consequently, this area gets very busy, but the view of Taipei 101 is very good. The party here starts at 18:30 and runs until 01:00. South of Taipei 101 </p>
