        <h2><strong>why do the dates of chinese new year change chinese new year animal rabbit</strong></h2>
        <p>Chinese New Year is extremely special because it’s all about tradition, celebration, and spending time with those who mean the most to you. One of the biggest questions people seem to have is about why the Chinese New Year date happens to change every 365 days. Here’s what you should know if you’re new to celebrating the holiday. 
The dates change every year because the festival is based on the Chinese Lunar Calendar. The lunar calendar is associated with the movement of the moon, which usually defines traditional festivals like the Chinese New Year (Spring Festival), Lantern Festival , Dragon Boat Festival , and Mid-Autumn Day . 
Why does Chinese New Year fall on different dates? Rather than following the western Gregorian Calendar with 365-day years, the Chinese New Year follows a lunar calendar based the moon's 12 phases  
During this time, people held sacrificial ceremonies in honor of gods at the beginning of the year. The date of the Chinese New Year was established during the Han Dynasty from 202 BC to 220 AD. Through the years, different ways of celebrating the New Year evolved. In 1949, the Chinese New Year was renamed the Spring Festival. 
Well, the Chinese New Year coincides with the lunar calendar, where the first day of the month begins during the new moon. This means that the Chinese New Year falls on different dates each year  
These intercalary months, also known as "embolismic months," help align the lunar calendar with the solar calendar by periodically adjusting the timing of the Chinese New Year. Leap months are necessary because the lunar year is about 10 to 12 days shorter than the solar year. 
Details: One year on a Gregorian calendar is 365 days, with a leftover "leap day" every few years. One year on a lunisolar calendar is 11 days shorter, and the difference gets rolled into leap months, rather than a leap day. That's why events like Lunar New Year can seem to move around a lot, when you try to map them onto the Gregorian calendar. 
The date on which Chinese New Year begins changes each year. This changes simply because Chinese New Year marks the beginning of the Lunar New Year, which is when there is the start of a new moon  
This Lunar New Year falls on Jan. 22, making it one of the earliest in recent history. So why does the date of the lunar new year change? Sun and moon. The Chinese calendar is both lunar and solar: months are based on the phases of the moon, and a year is based on the period of the sun. 
The date for Chinese New Year changes annually based on the lunar calendar, aligning with the first new moon of the year. For 2025, Chinese New Year will begin on January 29 , marking the start of the Year of the Dragon, one of the most revered symbols in Chinese culture, known for strength, courage, and good fortune. 
Mongolian lunar calendars, as well as Islamic and Jewish ones, for example, all have different months and cycles, and therefore celebrate Lunar New Year on different dates. Today, Chinese New Year is almost always celebrated on the second new moon following the winter solstice, therefore falling from late January to mid-February. 
Why Does Chinese New Year Date Change Every Year. China uses the Solar calendar (Gregorian calendar) and the lunar calendar to count the days. In the lunar calendar, the Chinese New Year always falls on the first day of the first month, but its date in the solar calendar changes every year. 
CHINESE NEW YEAR HISTORY . The origin of the Chinese New Year goes back to the Shang Dynasty from 1600 to 1046 BC. During this time, people held sacrificial ceremonies in honor of gods at the beginning of the year. The date of the Chinese New Year was established during the Han Dynasty from 202 BC to 220 AD. 
More than 1.5 billion people celebrate the Chinese New Year every year, marking the beginning of the upcoming 12 months on the traditional lunisolar calendar.
