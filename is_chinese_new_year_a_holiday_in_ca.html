CALIFORNIA, USA — A new bill signed by Governor Gavin Newsom is honoring an important cultural holiday in a new way. AB 2596 recognizes Lunar New Year as an official state holiday. 
Assembly Bill (AB) 2596, the legislation which designates Lunar New Year as a state holiday, was introduced by Chinese American Assemblymember Evan Low (D-Campbell) during Chinese New Year in February this year. Over 20 Chinese and Asian organizations came together urging Newsom to pass the bill. 
Aside from celebrating all federal holidays, California observes: Lunar New Year (Chinese New Year) – January 29, 2025; Rosa Parks Day – February 4; César Chávez Day – March 31 * CA Paid Holiday 
This year, for the first time, we are recognizing Lunar New Year as an official state holiday, honoring the invaluable contributions of Asian Americans to our California story and inviting everyone to appreciate the rich traditions of this special holiday. 
In his signing message, Governor Gavin Newsom said that recognizing Lunar New Year as a state holiday “acknowledges the diversity and cultural significance Asian Americans bring to California.” Lunar New Year is celebrated across Asia and has many names that vary by country. China’s Lunar New Year is known as the Spring Festival or  
A Chinese Lunar New Year fair in Chinatown in San Francisco.  (In California, 11 state holidays now come with a paid day off and four do not, including Lunar New Year.) 
Lunar New Year, also known as Chinese New Year, is a traditional holiday celebrated by many Asian cultures. It is based on the lunar calendar and falls on the first new moon of the year. The holiday is celebrated for 15 days, with the biggest celebrations held on the first day of the new year. 
Before Assemblymember Low’s introduction of AB 2596, in January 2022, Congresswoman Grace Meng (D-NY), Vice-Chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, announced her introduction of new legislation that credits a federal holiday for Lunar New Year. The Chinese Lunar Calendar determines the exact day of the Lunar New Year, which  
Lunar New Year, celebrated by Chinese communities worldwide, begins on January 29, 2025, and lasts up to 16 days. 2025 marks the Year of the Snake, associated with wisdom, intuition, and charm in  
receiving eight hours of personal holiday credit to observe the "Lunar New Year." The Lunar New Year celebrates a chance to leave behind the troubles of the past year and invite prosperity and good luck moving forward .

Beyond the newly introduced changes, China’s 2025 public holiday schedule still features two major week-long holidays: Spring Festival (also known as Chinese New Year) and the National Day holiday (often called ‘Golden Week’). 
Lunar New Year, a holiday important to many Asian Americans, is being celebrated as a state holiday for the first time. Gov. Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 2596 in September 2022, which made Lunar New Year a state holiday in California, thus allowing state employees to take eight hours off to celebrate it. Newsom also
