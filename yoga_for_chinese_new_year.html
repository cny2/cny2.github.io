Lion characters scare away last year’s bad luck. Chinese New Year ends with a big parade featuring a dragon. New Year celebrations last for fifteen days. Eating oranges, dumplings, and fish brings good luck. Family is the most important part of the New Year celebrations. “Gung Hay Fat Choy!” means “Happy New Year” in Chinese.

What is Chinese New Year? Chinese New Year is the most important of the Chinese holidays, and is a time of feasting with the family, celebration, fireworks and gift-giving. It is a 15-day holiday, beginning on the first day of a new moon and ending with the full moon on the day of the Lantern Festival.
