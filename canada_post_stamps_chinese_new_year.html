About the Stamps. Designed by Paprika, this collectible, wrap-up issue features all 24 of the original stamp designs – one Permanent ™ domestic rate stamp and one international stamp rate from each year – from the 2009 to 2020 Lunar New Year series.

On the domestic stamp, a red snake slithers on curving waves, symbolizing the water influence on this particular Year of the Snake. On the international stamp, a yellow and green jade snake, artfully embossed on multiple levels to provide three-dimensionality and simulate scales, coils into a stylized 8, the luckiest and most valued number by

Canada Post is celebrating the end of its 12-year Lunar New Year stamp series with a retrospective that “brings together in a single issue all of the stamps” from the series. This retrospective includes 24 stamps to be issued Jan. 15 in a pane of 12 and a booklet pane of 12. 
The issue will be the first release in a new 12-year Lunar New Year series. The international stamp was inspired by long traditions of Chinese art and Lunar New Year decor. “We featured a work of pottery, as the art form is heavily rooted in Chinese history,” explains Ivan Novotny, Vice President of Design at Toronto’s Taylor|Sprules  
The stamps, which mark the second release in a twelve-year Lunar New Year series, were designed by Wilco Design in Toronto. “The Year of the Tiger issue is a cross-cultural celebration of the tiger figure in the Chinese tradition,” says the firm’s principal, Wilson Lam. 
Another pair of Year of the Rat stamps (Scott #2257-28) were issued in 2008 to close out Canada Post’s previous Lunar New Year series. Designed by Toronto-based artist Harvey Chan, they feature two stylized rats based on another Chinese folk tale, “The Mouse Bride.” 
These stamps are the fourth release in a twelve-year Lunar New Year series. “Lunar New Year is celebrated around the world, in countries and territories with significant Chinese communities. Canada Post is proud to celebrate the occasion by issuing these popular stamps,” said Jim Phillips, Director of Stamp Services at Canada Post. 
Since then, Canada Post has been issuing a stamp for the Chinese New Year each year. 2009-2021 From 2009 to 2020, Canada Post issued an exquisite Chinese New Year stamp that was part of one of Canada Post’s most popular and longest-running series, which featured such elaborate techniques as gold and silver foiling and multi-level embossing. 
The new stamps mark the end of our second Lunar New Year series, which contained some of the most popular stamps we’ve ever produced. The first series ran from 1997 to 2008. “It’s a perennial favourite with collectors and consumers alike,” says Jim Phillips, Canada Post’s Director of Stamp Services.

Two commemorative stamps issued by Canada Post celebrate the Year of Snake, commencing January 24, 2001 and ending February 11, 2002. Many artists collaborated to create this issue, including designer Marlene Wou, jade sculptor Lyle Sopel, and calligrapher Yukman Lai. Wou chose a jade sculpture as the background because the semi-precious stone has long been valued by the Chinese culture. The
