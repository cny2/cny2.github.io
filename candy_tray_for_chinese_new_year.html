I never understood the significance of the Chinese New Year Candy Box a.k.a. Tray of Togetherness until much later in life. It is strange how little things I took for granted because they were there each and every year we celebrated the Chinese New Year in Malaysia were missed when we moved to the United States. 
A Tray of Togetherness is typically filled with candied fruits, seeds and nuts, many of which are only available around Chinese New Year. Here in the United States, it’s common to see candied coconut, lotus seeds and other items sold in Chinatown in small packages for less than $2 apiece.

When I was growing up, my grandmother had a strict no-snacking-before-dinner rule, but there was one exception: Chinese New Year. Once a year, she’d put out her Tray of Togetherness, or Chinese New Year candy box, on the coffee table for a few weeks, and my sister and I would giddily attack its contents every time we were at her house and fight over the popular candy flavors. 
Chinese New Year Candy Box. Also known as the “Tray of Togetherness”, these trays are round (to symbolize to togetherness), red (to symbolize good luck), and have either 6 or 8 compartments (6 and 8 are considered lucky numbers) of different candied fruit, each with their own special meaning.
