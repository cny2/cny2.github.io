        <h2><strong>why chinese new year called spring festival chinese new year celebration school</strong></h2>
        <p>Spring Festival 2025 falls on Wednesday, Jan 29th, 2025, beginning a year of the S nake. In China, Spring Festival is the common name for Chinese Lunar New Year. It's in winter, but the name Spring Festival has its reasons and an interesting history. 
In July of 1913, the young republic’s new president Yuan Shikai ruled that starting from 1914, the country would observe four national holidays, or one for each season. First up was the lunar New Year, which was to be renamed Spring Festival. 
Lunar New Year, also known as Chinese New Year or Spring Festival, is a major festival celebrated at the beginning of the Chinese lunisolar calendar. Thought to have originated in ancient China around 3,500 years ago, it is one of the most important holidays in Chinese culture, marking the end of winter and the beginning of the new year. 
In 1912, the government decided to abolish Chinese New Year and the lunar calendar, but adopted the Gregorian calendar instead and made January 1 the official start of the new year. After 1949, Chinese New Year was renamed to the Spring Festival. It was listed as a nationwide public holiday. 
According to the story, Chinese New Year's Day or the Spring Festival is also called "Guo Nian", which means surviving in the Nian's attack. The red becomes the most popular color for festival celebration and dressing code. 
The Chinese New Year and Spring Festival have a very long history that can be traced back 3,500 years into the past. The actual beginnings of the Chinese New Year tradition were not recorded clearly. However, many historians believe that the tradition began during the times of the Shang Dynasty (1600-1046 BC ). 
The centerpiece of the Spring Festival is the New Year's Eve reunion dinner. No matter how far apart, families make an effort to gather and share this special meal. BEIJING, Jan. 28 (Xinhua) -- Even though the Spring Festival officially falls on Jan. 29 this year, the Chinese people have already entered the festive "Guonian" period, which  
Why is it called the Spring Festival? Even though it is winter, the Chinese New Year is popularly known as the Spring Festival in China. Because it starts from the Beginning of Spring (the first of the twenty-four terms in coordination with the changes of Nature), it marks the end of winter and the beginning of spring. 
The Lunar New Year — known as the Spring Festival in China, Tet in Vietnam and Seollal in Korea — is a major festival celebrated in several Asian countries. In Taiwan, this year, people have been drawn to the White Snake Temple to pay their respects. 
Among China’s traditional holidays and celebrations, none ranks higher in importance than the Lunar New Year (農曆新年). Also known as the Spring Festival (春節), or simply Chinese New  
Before 1913, 'Spring Festival' was the first solar term known as Lichun, which could fall before or after the New Year and marked the end of winter, but now it became the new name for the New Year's celebration itself. The old Spring Festival, now in need of a new name, eventually became Farmers' Day in Republican China. 
How is Chinese New Year celebrated? Spring Festival is a time for families to come together, exchange money-filled red envelopes (红包, hóngbāo), and enjoy delicious Chinese food. The Chinese New Year is a 15-day holiday and includes a variety of festivities depending on the region and its local traditions and customs. 
The official usage of the name "Spring Festival" was retained by the government of the People's Republic of China, but the government of the Republic of China based in Taiwan has since adopted the name "Traditional Chinese New Year". [19] The festival is also called "Lunar New Year" in English, despite the traditional Chinese calendar being  
The holiday is sometimes called the Lunar New Year because the dates of celebration follow the phases of the moon. Since the mid-1990s people in China have been given seven consecutive days off work during the Chinese New Year. 
The Chinese New Year, also called Spring Festival, is the most important and widely celebrated festival of all in China. It is celebrated from the 1st day of the 1st lunar month to the 15th day of the 1st lunar month. 
Lunar New Year, festival typically celebrated in China and other Asian countries that begins with the first new moon of the lunar calendar and ends on the first full moon of the lunar calendar, 15 days later. The dates of the holiday vary from year to year, beginning some time between January 21 and February 20.

And January 1st was acknowledged as the New Year. But the folks were still allowed to use the lunar calendar and the traditional festival went on as usual. In July, 1913, Yuan Shikai acknowledged Zheng Yue Chu Yi (Lunar January 1st) as Spring Festival. Since then, the Chinese New Year has been generally called Spring Festival. 2. Spring
