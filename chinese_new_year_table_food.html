        <p>The auspicious symbolism of these traditional Chinese New Year foods is based on their pronunciations or appearance. Not only do the dishes themselves matter, but also the preparation, and ways of serving and eating mean a lot. The most common Chinese New Year foods include dumplings, fish, spring rolls, and niangao. We've rounded up 12  
Upon the bright dawn of Chinese New Year, tradition paints the table with a vivid palette of delicacies, with each mouthful not only a flavour but a wish spoken into the breeze. Each dish tells a fortune narrative, from the crescent moon of plump dumplings, which represents abundant money, to the whole fish, which gleams with scales of  
Also called Spring Festival in most of mainland China, Lunar New Year begins on the night of the first new moon of the lunisolar calendar, which is a bit shorter than the 365-day solar year. The 16-day festival season is celebrated with lots of traditional Chinese New Year foods that are prepared, served and eaten in symbolic ways. 
Glutinous rice cake – Niangao is also a common New Year food, as its name sounds like “getting higher year-on-year,” a wish for prosperity. 2. Chow Mein Noodles. Longevity noodles (Chang Shou Mian / chung-show mien) are another unsurprising addition to the Chinese New Year table. 
Chinese people from Shanghai and Suzhou must have “Ruyi food” at the dinner table, wishing them all the best in the new year. In addition, Soybean sprout is a kind of sprouted vegetable, symbolizing rise and growth, which is very auspicious. 
Traditionally filled with a mixture of meat, tofu, egg, and/or vegetables, dumplings are a staple of Chinese cuisine and a must-have at every Lunar New Year table. 
The Chinese New Year, also known as Lunar New Year, is the most important festival in China: it lasts up to two weeks and is the only time of the year when China shuts down. Unlike Western countries, the Chinese New Year generally falls between January 21st and February 20th in the Gregorian calendar, according to the Chinese lunar calendar. 
You may think “Lunar New Year” and “Chinese New Year” refer to the same event. That’s not the case! The Lunar New Year celebration in South Korea or Vietnam looks different than a celebration of the Lunar New Year in China. The holidays take place on different dates, too. In 2025, China begins to celebrate its Lunar New Year on  
Chinese New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, is a time to gather with loved ones, share blessings, and enjoy symbolic dishes that usher in good fortune. Every dish on the table carries a unique meaning, rooted in centuries of tradition. 
Chinese people eat foods with the symbols of good luck, prosperity, and happiness during the Chinese New Year. The lunar New Year 2025 is coming, try these traditional dishes with auspicious meanings and have good fortune in the new year. 1. Fish - Fortune and Abundance 
This is the amusing moment a cheeky pet dog stole freshly cooked food that was laid out for Chinese New Year celebrations. A Chinese-Thai family prepared offerings for the festival and set up a  
Food is one of the things that the Chinese take the most pride in. And of course, a lot of care and thought is put into the menu for the most important holiday of the year. As with Chinese New Year activities and decorations, the dishes are created to give blessings for the next year.

During Chinese New Year, families indulge in the Tray of Togetherness, sample Nian Gao for good luck, and savour an eight-course feast, each steeped in tradition and symbolic meaning. 
Another food you definitely want to put on your Chinese New Year food list for this Year of the Tiger is tang yuan — black sesame filled sweet rice balls that are typically served in a sweet soup. These little balls of joy symbolize a happy family reunion because their name sounds like a Chinese phrase for ‘reunion’ and ‘togetherness’. 
Chinese New Year Side Dishes. Even some vegetable dishes are iconic Chinese New Year foods. Buddha’s Delight, consisting of at least 8 ingredients, is often eaten the morning of Chinese New Year after a ceremonial offering of food to honor family ancestors. 
Marinate the Beef: In a bowl, combine the beef slices with soy sauce, hoisin sauce, and Shaoxing wine. Let it marinate for 20 minutes. Prepare the Noodles: Cook the Chinese wheat noodles according to the package instructions. 
There are also the 7 lucky foods for chinese new year.Oranges, tangerines, kumquats, and pomelos are given as gifts. They represent happiness, wealth, and luck. On the other hand, foods like bitter melon and broken noodles are avoided.

A red tablecloth adds a pop of color to the eating area—just add elegant white dinnerware and an embroidered table runner in a neutral color to balance out
