Celebrate Lunar New Year with nian gao (年糕), a steamed rice cake made of glutinous rice flour and brown sugar. This is based on Mama Lin's recipe.

Pour warm water into a small bowl, then sprinkle yeast over the surface. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.

And I was thrilled to find out that my mom’s favorite sweet rice flour by Koda Farms. is produced in a rice only facility that is free of the top 8 allergens, gluten free, and GMO free.
