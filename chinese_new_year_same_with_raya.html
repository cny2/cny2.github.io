The title term Kongsi Raya refers to the years when the dates of Chinese New Year and Hari Raya Aidilfitri take place in the same period of time. This happens every 33 years due to Islamic calendar shifts. From 1996 to 1998, Chinese New Year and Hari Raya used to fall on the same week. This situation will repeat between 2029 and 2031. 
From 1996 to 1998, Hari Raya Aidilfitri and Chinese New Year occurred on the same week. Originated in Malaysia, the catchphrase Kongsi Raya was the tagline of Subang Parade department store in Subang Jaya in 1996. It was a wordplay on the Chinese New Year greeting, “Gong Xi Fa Cai” and “Raya” from Islamic holiday Hari Raya.
