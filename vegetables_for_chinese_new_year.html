        <p>This tray symbolizes a happy and healthy beginning for the Chinese New Year and is often given as a house warming gift to the host of a new years’ get-together. Often, the treats used are symbolic themselves, including special “fortune candies,” and colorful dried fruits that symbolize prosperity and fortune , like apricots, mango, and  
The auspicious symbolism of these traditional Chinese New Year foods is based on their pronunciations or appearance. Not only do the dishes themselves matter, but also the preparation, and ways of serving and eating mean a lot. The most common Chinese New Year foods include dumplings, fish, spring rolls, and niangao. We've rounded up 12  
Most Americans consider January 1 the start of the new year, but many Asians and Asian-Americans don’t. Instead, they follow Lunar New Year, also referred to as Chinese New Year in the U.S., which begins on January 29, 2025. (That’s the Year of the Snake in the Chinese zodiac, BTW.) 
Next week, on Jan. 29, begins the celebration that is known as Lunar New Year. Lunar New Year is the biggest and most important holiday in China and Chinese communities around the world. It is a 15-day festival meant to be a celebration for the arrival of spring, according to National Geographic. And at the heart of all the celebrations? Food. 
Chinese New Year Side Dishes. Even some vegetable dishes are iconic Chinese New Year foods. Buddha’s Delight, consisting of at least 8 ingredients, is often eaten the morning of Chinese New Year after a ceremonial offering of food to honor family ancestors. 
Spring Vegetable Salad, with its crispness and vibrant colours, becomes a palate-cleansing herald of freshness and new beginnings in Lunar New Year festivities. Laden with a variety of seasonal greens and vegetables, symbolizes the rejuvenation of spring. 
The holiday continues for two weeks, culminating in the Lantern Festival on February 24. Each year, the calendar aligns with an animal in the Chinese zodiac. 2024 is the Year of the Dragon, an animal that embodies good luck, strength and health. Like any holiday, Lunar New Year has many traditions. 
Chinese-style braised pork knuckle is a popular Chinese New Year dish in Cantonese. The pork knuckle is cooked with black moss called fat choy, dried mushrooms, and dried oysters. It is incredibly flavorful, and the umami from the dried seafood is exceptional. This auspicious Chinese New Year meal is popular because the name has a unique meaning. 
This winter vegetable hits the wet markets around Chinese New Year in a big way because of this dish. When pronouncing ta ke cai in the Shanghainese dialect, it sounds like ta ku cai (脱苦菜), reminiscent of the phrase, 脱离苦海, which means, “to get out of the bitter sea.” 
Slither into the Year of the Snake as you set up for Lunar New Year 2025, which runs this year from January 29 to February 8. Widely celebrated by Asian communities in China, East Asia, and around  
Vegetables are not only fundamental to Chinese New Year but also to Chinese cuisine as a whole. People love to eat green, leafy vegetables at each meal because they’re not only incredibly healthy but also versatile in a vast number of recipes. 
Serve this spicy pork-and-vegetable lo mein for Chinese New Year or for dinner anytime. While some cooks like to cut the noodles into 6- to 8-inch lengths to make them easier to combine with other  
Marinate the Beef: In a bowl, combine the beef slices with soy sauce, hoisin sauce, and Shaoxing wine. Let it marinate for 20 minutes. Prepare the Noodles: Cook the Chinese wheat noodles according to the package instructions.

Every 7th day of Chinese New Year (also called 'Ren Ri' ; 人日), Ah-mm will tell me to go and buy 7 types of vegetables for her to cook 七样菜. 人日 is literally 'human day'. According to Chinese legend, 女媧 created different animals on different days. Humans were created on the 7th day after she created the world, so Ren Ri is also known as everyone's birthday. Don't be surprised if

So eating mud carp symbolizes a good relationship and fortune. The Chinese for “catfish” sounds like the word meaning “year plus”. So eating catfish is a wish for a surplus in the new year. Chinese people eat one fish on New Year’s Eve and one on New Year’s Day to symbolize a surplus year after year.
