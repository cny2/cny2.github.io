        <p>With the Lunar New Year fast approaching, salons worldwide are experiencing their busiest times, thanks to the Chinese tradition of getting a fresh haircut to ring in the new year. We can’t guarantee that a new hairstyle will bring you new wealth in the coming year but it certainly will make you feel fabulous during the festivities. 
There are many Chinese New Year traditions about dos and don'ts. Find out the top 18 things you should not do. Some are taboos on the first day of the Chinese New Year and some are superstitions for the whole New Year Festival season (from the 1st to 15th of the Lunar New Year). 1. Avoid taking medicine.

To prepare for the new year, many people like to get a haircut or new hairstyle for a new look in the coming year. No cleaning/sweeping the floors. For some families, it’s important to clean the house before the first day of the Lunar New Year. The idea is to get rid of the bad spirits and not to carry the old stuff into the new year. 
The annual Chinese Spring Festival is a time for celebration and renewal, which includes the belief that a new haircut can avert bad luck, but the practice has unexpected and amusing results for some. 
The haircut tradition is one of many Chinese New Year superstitions, and one that annually creates a boom and bust period for the nation's hairdressers. But they are not the only ones looking to

(Photography: Minchen Liang / EyeEm via Getty Images) Remember these Chinese New Year traditions, and good fortune is guaranteed to come your way (we mean, maybe). Chinese New Year is the time where family and friends gather to celebrate a year of happiness, prosperity, health, and good fortune. 
Why a haircut is important to the Chinese New Year tradition. 
The Chinese zodiac’s traditions and customs resonate through our actions even in contemporary settings. As the Year of the Snake approaches, we should not underestimate the influence of some of the common folklore beliefs. 
This year, Chinese New Year begins on Wednesday, January 29. Those who celebrate will be entering the year of the snake. Just like with any holiday, traditions abound for Chinese New Year. Some of  
The fifth animal in the Chinese zodiac, the dragon is believed to represent strength, health, good luck and yang - the universe's masculine energy in Taoist tradition. The date of Lunar New Year  
Chinese New Year may be all about food and fireworks to onlookers but preparations involve a lot more than meets the eye. Kamay Kan, 27, lives in north London and has been telling Newsbeat about  
No festival is complete without decorations. For Chinese New Year that means lanterns and couplets. Lanterns are often associated with New Year but have their own festival on the 15 th day of the new year. In 2025 it falls on February 12 th. For Chinese New Year itself, New Year Couplets are the most important decorations. 
In Chinese tradition, cleaning during the new year is believed to sweep away wealth and good fortune. Even taking out the garbage is seen as tossing out prosperity from the home. So, yes – this gives you the perfect excuse to put off housework until after Chinese New Year. Let the tradition work in your favour! 11. Enjoy festive CNY events 
The Chinese word for “book” (shū) sounds exactly the same as the word for “lose” – so buying a book right after ringing in the New Year is considered an invitation for bad luck. 
9. Do not give New Year blessings to someone still in bed. You are supposed to give New Year blessings (拜年 / bài nián). But let the recipient get up from bed first. Otherwise, they’ll be bed-ridden for the entire year. You also shouldn’t tell someone to wake up. You don’t want them to be rushed around or bossed for the year. 
It is the longest and most important festival in China. Other countries and regions with large Chinese populations, such as Hong Kong, Thailand, and the Philippines, also celebrate the Chinese New Year. Chinese New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, is the most important holiday in China. 
Taking a bath in the middle of the night on New Year’s Eve, getting a haircut before the new year and the unacceptable act of sweeping the house during the first three days are all common Chinese New Year practices drilled into our minds. But among the younger generations, these customs are now more commonly attributed to old wives’ tales. 
Being a 15-day celebration, there are many Chinese New Year traditions and customs to observe, some of which are apparently only particular to Singaporeans!
