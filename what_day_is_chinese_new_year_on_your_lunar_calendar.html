        <p>2025 Lunar New Year falls on January 29th. The public holiday lasts from January 28th to February 3rd, during which the New Year's Eve on January 28th and the New Year's Day on January 29th are the peak time of celebration. The commonly known New Year calendar counts from the New Year's Eve to the Lantern Festival on February 12th 2025. 
The lunar calendar, unlike the Gregorian calendar, uses the phases of the moon to delineate days, weeks and months of the year. A lunar month is the period of time from one new moon to the next

Therefore, the Chinese year usually begins several weeks into the Western 365-day year (usually between January 21 and February 20), not on January 1 of the Gregorian calendar. As is ancient tradition, the Chinese zodiac attaches animal signs to each lunar year in a cycle of 12 years. 
Chinese New Year, also known as Lunar New Year or Spring Festival, is the most important festival in China and a major event in some other East Asian countries.
