        <h2><strong>15th day after chinese new year sales chinese new year mp3 download</strong></h2>
        <p>Fourth Day of Chinese New Year 初四. The day to honour the Kitchen god who would return to Heaven to report on the family to the Jade Emperor, some place nian2 gao1 (New Year Sticky Cake) as offerings to appease the Kitchen god who then either can’t speak much due to the stickiness of the sweet cake or speaks sweet nothings about the family. 
Chinese New Year or Lunar New Year celebration usually lasts 15 days, from New Year's Eve to the 15th day of the Chinese New Year—the Lantern Festival.In 2025, the celebration starts on Jan. 28th and ends on Feb. 12th. 
But Chinese people typically view the entire 15 days following 除夕 (chú xī) as the New Year Festival, and so the celebratory activities continuously span from 除夕 (chú xī) all the way to 正月十五 (zhēng yuè shí wǔ) - the 15th day of the first lunar month. 
People will prepare the food for all the days from the starting of Chinese New Year on the 1st day of the 1st lunar month to the Lantern Festival on the 15th day, for in old times, nothing could be bought during that period. Also on this day, people will decorate the rooms by pasting paper-cuts on the windows. 
Everyone is familiar with the fundamental aspects of Chinese New Year, such as enjoying a reunion dinner on the eve, visiting relatives and friends, and partaking in the overall celebrations. However, it might be less commonly known that the traditional 15-day period of Chinese New Year encompasses its own set of customs and practices. 
On the 15th day of the first lunar month, two weeks after Chinese New Year, another important traditional Chinese festival, the Chinese Lantern Festival or Yuan Xiao Jie or Yuanxiao Festival (元宵节), is celebrated. It marks the first full moon of the new lunar year and the end of the Chinese New Year (Spring Festival 
The first day of the New Year is known as Yuan Dan (Chinese: 元旦; pinyin: yuándàn (First Morning of the year), New Year’s Day, First Day (or Duan Ri). During the 15 day period new year visits (Traditional Chinese: 拜年; pinyin: bài nián, translated: pay respect, worship, salute the year) will be made to family and friends. 
During Chinese New Year, people have a long list of things to do. From one week preceding the festival to the 15th day after, many Chinese New Year customs are widely observed for thousands of years. The family reunion dinner, eating dumplings, and setting off firework are the must-dos that you might know. What else interesting do the Chinese do? 
About 1,800 to 2,200 years ago, the word “Mid-autumn” was started to be used to record the festival. Since 1,100 to 1,400 years ago, mooncake has been widely eaten on the festival date. In the Northern Song Dynasty about 900 to 1,000 years ago, the 15th day of 8th lunar month was finally set as the official festival date. 
Chinese New Year is not just one day but over 30 days of festivities and activities, which have their own calendar. The preparation begins on the first of the Lunar Calendar and the celebration lasts until the 15th of the first month. In 2025, Chinese New Year begins on January 29th and ends on February 12th with the Lantern Festival. 
Lunar new year day 11 is known as the "son-in-law" day, it is the day when the father in law treat the son-in-law. After the celebration of Day 9 - Birthday of "天公", there is a lot of leftover, so on this day, all these delicacy can be served to the son-in-law, in order not waste and also save money for the in-law side.

The Tang Dynasty period (618-907 AD) allows a change of paradigm in the Spring Festival celebration and the main function of the festival has also shifted.The festival was no longer perceived as a sacred ritual for the gods—which was the norm established for thousands of years—, and now the New Year was celebrated mainly as entertainment for both nobles and commoners. 
The Chinese New Year begins with the new moon on the first day of the lunar year and ends on the full moon 15 days later. This period is filled with a plethora of traditions and rituals, each day  
Less well publicized, however, are the 15 days of Chinese New Year, the festival season that stretches from the new moon on New Year’s Day until the full moon on the Lantern Festival. Most of the traditions associated with the 15 day celebration of Chinese New Year date to ancient China.
