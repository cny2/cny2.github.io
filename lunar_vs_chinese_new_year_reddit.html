        <h2><strong>lunar vs chinese new year reddit cctv chinese new year gala live stream</strong></h2>
        <p>The Chinese new year is from the American perspective, because The Chinese came to USA earlier that other Asian Group. My personal view is that you can say Chinese New Year to the other person as long as they are Chinese. Or you are a Chinese you want to wish western people a happy Chinese new year. 
If one HAS to make some sort of distinction, then I think "Chinese" for the new year that falls between January 21 and February 20 makes more sense than "Lunar" because it's the specific lunar calendar that's based on the Chinese lunar calendar (the Vietnamese and Korean lunar calendar are basically based on the chinese one, the difference is  
Yeah grew up knowing it's Chinese New year and everywhere the short form is CNY. Also well known in Singapore each ethnicity gets 2 days of public holidays. Since these 2 days are given to Chinese so it's natural we have always known it as Chinese New year. All my friends from other races are wishing me Happy Chinese new year today. 
I understand many of the customs of CNY is shared all across Asia, but whenever I'm abroad saying Happy CNY feels stupid, Many other Asian 
27th January 2025 – (Hong Kong) The recent controversy over whether to call the upcoming spring festival “Chinese New Year” or “Lunar New Year” reflects a deeper understanding of contextual communication that the rest of the world might do well to observe. 
Simply put, Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year are not the same. Despite being related, there are a few noteworthy differences between the two. Read on to find out what they are. The Differences between Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year 1. "Chinese New Year" is specific while "Lunar New Year" is more general. 
State-run news agency Xinhua, for instance, hailed the celebration of “Chinese Lunar New Year” in Myanmar, Malaysia and Japan, emphasizing the use of “Chinese red” in decorations. 
Ever wondered if we should be using the term ‘Chinese New Year’ or ‘Lunar New Year’? Well, a Xiaohongshu user has entered the discussion in hopes of answering that question once and for all. In their post “Chinese New Year, not Lunar New Year”, they wrote: “I encourage everyone to not replace the name CNY with ‘Lunar New Year’.” 
Most people in the UK recognise New Year's Eve as 31 December, however the Chinese and Lunar New Year varies year on year, yet usually falls around the end of January. 
What Are the Key Differences Between Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year? Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year are often used interchangeably, but they have distinct differences. Chinese New Year specifically refers to the celebration in China and among Chinese communities worldwide, while Lunar New Year is a broader term that includes various  
Let me pull out an interesting sentence for you: The Lunar New Year celebrations of the East Asian cultural sphere occur on the same date across the region, on the new moon, which occurs in late January or early February, and are based on the Chinese lunisolar calendar. 
The problem with calling Chinese New Year lunar new year is that the Chinese calendar is a lunisolar calendar not a lunar calendar. the Islamic calendar is the only major calendar that is actually a lunar calendar. furthermore, most calendars in the world are lunisolar/lunar; such as the Jewish, Indian, Persia, etc. 
Happy tet. Happy Chunjie. Happy seollal etc. If u and the recipient are of different culture, its best to say both. Happy korean new year and chinese new year! “Happy lunar new year” should be ok too, but now its associated with intention of not wanting to say “happy chinese new year” so some chinese people might not like hearing it. 
The actual real lunar new year is based on the Islamic calendar. Chinese people don’t even call it “Chinese New Year”. They call it 春節 or Spring Festival or 農曆新年 or Agricultural New Year. Both these names, Agricultural New Year and Spring Festival are more accurate names than Lunar New Year. 
Am Chinese, Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year aren't the same thing. Lots of cultures celebrate Lunar New Year, but Chinese New Year has its own specific details. There's a lot of nationalism among Chinese unfortunately especially first generation. Those that grew up outside of China (and thus didn't get brainwashed by the CCP) are more chill. 
This was prompted by NewJeans Danielle's controversy and apology for saying 'Chinese New Year'. It just feels like a controversy that is waiting to happen every New Year, some idol will inevitably say Chinese New Year (CNY) instead of Lunar New Year (LNY) and knets will begin to dogpile them and release their sin 
It is not “colonizer vibes” if Chinese people want to call it Chinese New Year. How Chinese people celebrate it is their own business and people need to stop dictating what Chinese people are calling their own holiday. If people want to call it Lunar New Year because how they celebrate is different than how Chinese people celebrate, then  
Services are available for tourists of course, especially in big metropolis like Ho Chi Minh city, but could be suboptimal and patchy. If you like the whole special feelings leading up to Lunar New Year, stay there up until a few days before the New Year, but leave right before the first day of Tet (how they call New Year in Vietnam). 
The Year of the Snake.Here's your guide to the Lunar New Year. When does Chinese New Year start and end? Chinese New Year in 2025 starts on Wednesday, Jan. 29, and lasts until the Lantern Festival  
I'm currently in China and recently there's been a debate that started on Twitter when a British museum referred to the lunar new year as being the "Korean Lunar New Year", after this Chinese netizens were upset and claim that the Lunar New Year orginated from China so therefore belongs to China. </p>
