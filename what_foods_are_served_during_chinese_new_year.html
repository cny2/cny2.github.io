Chinese New Year is steeped in traditions and symbolism, with various foods believed to bring good luck and fortune for the year ahead. Fish is a must-have dish, symbolising surplus and abundance. Dumplings (jiaozi) are widely consumed during this time, representing prosperity and wealth due to their resemblance to ancient Chinese money. 
Food is one of the things that the Chinese take the most pride in. And of course, a lot of care and thought is put into the menu for the most important holiday of the year. As with Chinese New Year activities and decorations, the dishes are created to give blessings for the next year.
