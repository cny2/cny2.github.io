        <h2><strong>chinese new year willow pattern story chinese new year buffet in kl</strong></h2>
        <p>Blue Willow, specifically gold-rimmed pieces coming from Gilman Collamore, New York, was the china of choice at William Randolph Hearst's "La Cuesta Encantada" estate in San Simeon, California, being Hearst's mother's favorite pattern. 
The blue willow story is a traditional Chinese story about two star-crossed lovers, roughly estimated to have been created in the 1780s. These two lovers, a girl and a boy, fall into a forbidden love, which is considered inappropriate at the time due to the gap between their social classes. 
Rumour has it that the Willow Pattern was first created in the late 18th century by Thomas Minton, an English potter who founded the Minton pottery company in Stoke-on-Trent. According to the story, Minton was inspired by the exotic Chinese porcelain that was in high demand among European collectors at the time. 
The Willow Legend There was once a Mandarin who had a beautiful daughter, Koong-se. He employed a secretary, Chang who, while he was attending to his master's accounts, fell in love with Koong-se, much to the anger of the Mandarin, who regarded the secretary as unworthy of his daughter. 
This instantly recognisable pattern is a classic Chinese landscape design, the fundamentals of which include a weeping willow, pagodas, a crooked fence, a tree bearing fruit, three or four figures on a bridge, a boat and a pair of lovebirds forever kissing. 
The Willow Pattern was a blue and white transfer-printed composite design which brought together Buddhist imagery, pagodas, landscapes, birds and trees from Chinese porcelain. The pattern is said to be woven around a romantic story of star-crossed lovers eloping together. 
Developed by Thomas Turner in 1779, the Blue Willow pattern eventually became a classic fixture on many tables around the world. The pattern is actually English, although it is based on similar blue landscape designs in Chinese porcelain. 
However, this is not just a personal story. Let's delve into the numbers, particularly the surge in “dragon babies”. In 2024, during the Year of the Dragon, China witnessed a 5.7% year-on-year increase in births, with South Korea seeing a 3% rise. These spikes are noteworthy, considering both nations are grappling with declining birth rates.
