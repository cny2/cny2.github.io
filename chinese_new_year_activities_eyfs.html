What is Chinese New Year? Unlike the UK which uses the Gregorian calendar and celebrates the start of the new year as January 1st, Chinese New Year follows the lunar calendar and so it changes every year. But it's always between January 21st and February 21st, coinciding with the first new moon – the darkest day.
