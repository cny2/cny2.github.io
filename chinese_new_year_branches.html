        <h2><strong>chinese new year branches chinese new year and mandarin orange</strong></h2>
        <p>Though they evolved separately, the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches have long since been combined to form the 60-year sexagenary cycle. In ancient China, the year was identified by two characters, the first from one of the 10 Stems, the second from one of the 12 Branches. The first combination is always Jia-Zi, while the last is always Gui-Hai. 
The Earthly Branches (also called the Terrestrial Branches or the 12-cycle [1]) are a system of twelve ordered symbols used throughout East Asia. They are indigenous to China, and are themselves Chinese characters , corresponding to words with no concrete meaning other than the associated branch's ordinal position in the list. 
This is the use of the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches. It’s used for recording the year, month and day. Hereunder is how to calculate the year and month: Calculate the year: As you can see from the Chinese calendar, 2015 is Yi Wei Year. To get this, follow the steps below: 
When counting years, people use them with the 12 Chinese zodiacs and strictly one Earthly Branch corresponds to one fixed zodiac. For example, our ancestors have divided a day and night into twelve sections and named each as a 'shi chen', which is equal to today's two hours and has a fixed Earthly Branch name. 
They matched those twelve parts with twelve earthly branches, which also match the twelve Chinese zodiacs. These three counting systems make up the unique ancient Chinese time. The ten Celestial Stems, called “天干-(tiān gān)”, pair with the Earthly Branches for a 60-year calendrical cycle. 
The origins of the 12 Earthly Branches, or “地支” (di zhi), can be traced back to the Shang dynasty (c. 1600–1046 BCE). Rooted in ancient astronomical observations, this system was initially based on the orbit of Jupiter, known as the “year star” in traditional Chinese astronomy. 
For example, a Western year ending in 0 always mostly corresponds to a Chinese G (gēng 庚) year; a Western year ending in 1 will be a Chinese H (xīn 辛) year; a year ending in 2 an I (rén 壬) year, and so on. Earth Branches. The twelve Earth Branches are aligned with the famous year animals used in Chinese astrology. 
This is a craft with a history of at least one thousand years. In line with all New Year decorations, these paintings are used by the people to express their wishes for the future year. The traditional Chinese art style is used, but with the invention of printing technology the style and image depicted diversified. 
Each year is named by a pair of one stem and one branch. The Year of Jia Zi (Jia from the heavenly stems and Zi from the earthly branches) is the beginning of the sexagenary cycle. The next Jia Zi Year will come 60 years later. Jia Zi has had a figurative meaning a full lifespan in ancient times, similarly the 'threescore years and ten' in the  
The Chinese New Year Day list also contains the Chinese Zodiac Sign, which is from the Chinese Stem-Branch calendar. The system of the Stem-Branch is a cycle of sixty. It's from Green-Wood Rat to Black-Water Pig. Therefore, you can see the entire cycle from 1924 to 1983, or from 1984 to 2043. Each line of the list contains the Chinese New Year
