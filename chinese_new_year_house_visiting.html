Visiting extended family and friends during the week of Chinese New Year and exchanging gifts is a Chinese New year tradition that goes on throughout the 15-day holiday. This process of visiting family and friends is called bài nián (拜年), in which you wish everyone a happy and healthy new year. 
House visiting on this day also follows specific customs, emphasising the importance of visiting senior members of extended families first to convey good fortune (and possibly receive ang pows in return). A notable tradition on the second day of the Chinese New Year, known as 初二, involves welcoming sons-in-law. 
1. Cleaning the House Before New Year’s Day Credit: Giphy. Before the celebrations kick off, families deep-clean their homes to sweep away bad luck and make room for good fortune. But don’t lift a broom on New Year’s Day—it’s believed to sweep away your luck for the year!

On the 28th, 29th or 30th day of the new year, every household "posts the New Year's Red" (the New Year's Red is the collective name for the red festive elements pasted during the New Year, such as Spring Festival couplets, door gods, horizontal batches, New Year pictures, and the word "Fu"). 
Be aware that you may find many things closed at that time. Museums, small restaurants and shops may be closed the week of the Chinese New Year holiday. You'll also have to deal with people going back to work when the holiday ends. You don't have to wait for months after Chinese New Year. Even 10 days afterward would probably be okay. 
Gifting during Chinese New Year is rooted in wishing each other a prosperous year ahead. Giving gifts to families during Chinese New Year house visits is customary, symbolising the desire for a blessed year.

Honoring the dead is a Chinese New Year's tradition that's kept to the word. Many Chinese people visit ancestors' graves on the day before the Chinese New Year's day, offer sacrifices to ancestors before the reunion dinner (to show that they are letting their ancestors "eat" first), and add an extra glass and place it at the dinner table on New Year's eve.
