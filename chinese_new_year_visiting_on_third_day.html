As the Lunar New Year unfolds, the third day, known as "Chor 3" in Cantonese dialect, carries its own significance in the tapestry of Chinese New Year traditions. It marks a continuation of familial ties, cultural celebrations, and the beginning of auspicious practices that shape the spirit of the festive season. 
The first day of the New Year is known as Yuan Dan (Chinese: 元旦; pinyin: yuándàn (First Morning of the year), New Year’s Day, First Day (or Duan Ri). During the 15 day period new year visits (Traditional Chinese: 拜年; pinyin: bài nián, translated: pay respect, worship, salute the year) will be made to family and friends. 
The second Day of 2025 Chinese New Year is the Son-in-Law Day, Thursday, January 30, 2025. A married man with his wife and children should visit his parents-in-law. January 30, 2025 is the birthday of Dog.

According to Chinese custom, married daughters should visit their parents only on the second day of the Chinese New Year.

The lunisolar Chinese calendar determines the date of Lunar New Year.
