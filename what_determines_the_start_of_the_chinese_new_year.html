        <h2><strong>what determines the start of the chinese new year wishes during chinese new year</strong></h2>
        <p>Calculation of the Chinese New Year has a set of rules. However, many exceptions can make things confusing. Generally speaking, the Chinese New Year falls between January 21 and February 21. The precise date is the second new moon after the December solstice (December 21) Each year the date is pushed back by 10, 11, or even 12 days compared to  
The first 2 days of Chinese New Year. [50] 2 Brunei: Tahun Baru Cina: Half-day on Chinese New Year's Eve and the first day of Chinese New Year.

In 1912, the government decided to abolish Chinese New Year and the lunar calendar, but adopted the Gregorian calendar instead and made January 1 the official start of the new year. After 1949, Chinese New Year was renamed to the Spring Festival. It was listed as a nationwide public holiday. 
Since the mid-1990s people in China have been given seven consecutive days off work during the Chinese New Year. This week of relaxation has been designated Spring Festival, a term that is sometimes used to refer to the Chinese New Year in general. The origins of the Chinese New Year are steeped in legend. One legend is that thousands of years  
The traditional Chinese calendar, which determines the date of the Lunar New Year, is lunisolar, which means it's based on the cycle of the moon as well as on Earth's course around the sun. A month on this Chinese calendar is 28 days long, and a normal year lasts from 353 to 355 days [source: timeanddate.com]. 
For more than 3,000 years, Lunar New Year was just what it sounds like—the beginning of a new year in the Chinese calendar. The historic Chinese calendar is a lunisolar calendar, meaning dates are determined by both the moon (lunar) and the sun (solar). 
When is Chinese New Year? The date of the Chinese New Year is determined by the traditional Chinese calendar, a lunisolar calendar that blends solar, lunar, and other cycles. The holiday falls on the second new moon after the winter solstice on December 21. Each year the New Year in China falls on a different date than on the Gregorian calendar. 
Lunar New Year is the beginning of a new year based on lunar calendars or, informally but more widely, lunisolar calendars.Typically, both types of calendar begin with a new moon but, whilst a lunar calendar year has a fixed number (usually twelve) lunar months, lunisolar calendars have a variable number of lunar months, resetting the count periodically to resynchronise with the solar year. 
The lunisolar Chinese calendar determines the date of Lunar New Year. The calendar is also used in countries that have been influenced by, or have relations with, China – such as Korea, Japan, and Vietnam, though occasionally the date celebrated may differ by one day or even one moon cycle due to using a meridian based on a different capital city in a different time zone or different  
As its name suggests, the date of the lunar new year depends on the phase of the moon and varies from year to year. Each year in the lunar calendar is named one of the 12 animals in the Chinese  
Hence a lunar year consisting of 12 months will be about 12 x 29.5 = 354 days. So a lunar year is about 11 days shorter than a solar year. The second rule of thumb is therefore that most of the time Chinese New Year will fall 11 (or sometimes 10 or 12) days earlier than the previous year, but if that would take us outside of the Chinese New  
Chinese New Year is the most important festival in China. In China, the Gregorian calendar is the official calendar, but Chinese New Year is calculated according to the traditional Chinese calendar. Chinese New Year Day is always the first day of the first month in the Chinese calendar, however, the date changes each year in the Gregorian calendar. 
What determines the date of Chinese New Year? The Moon. Like Easter in Christianity, Chinese New Year is a lunar festival. It begins with the New Moon, so it starts on January 25, 2020 and ends on  
Chinese New Year 2025 will begin on January 29 according to the Gregorian calendar followed worldwide. This year the Chinese New Year features the year to be of 'wood snake.' There are 12 chinese  
The Chinese New Year dates are determined by the Chinese lunisolar calendar, which divides the year into 24 solar terms, making up 12 lunar months. According to the Chinese calendar, the winter solstice falls in the 11 th lunar month – and in practice, Chinese New Year usually falls on the second new moon after the winter solstice. 
(The first is Mandarin; the second, Cantonese. Both are literally “New Year Happiness!” or “Happy New Year!” Lunar New Year. The Lunar New Year is determined by cycles of the moon and therefore the dates are movable, each new year commencing on the new moon which occurred in the late January or February of the Western Calendar. 
Today, Chinese workers get a week-long holiday that extends through the first half of the Chinese New Year period, and they have returned to celebrating the holiday in a big way [source: History.com]. But how are the exact dates of Chinese New Year determined each year? Read on to the next page to find out. 
The legal holiday is seven days long, from the Lunar New Year's Eve to the sixth day of the first lunar month. Some companies and public institutions enjoy a longer holiday up to 10 days or more, because in common knowledge among Chinese people, the festival lasts longer, from the Lunar New Year's Eve to the 15th day of the first lunar month (Lantern Festival). 
Lunar New Year, festival typically celebrated in China and other Asian countries that begins with the first new moon of the lunar calendar and ends on the first full moon of the lunar calendar, 15 days later. The dates of the holiday vary from year to year, beginning some time between January 21 and February 20. 
When did the Chinese new year start in 2013? The Chinese New Year started on Sunday, February 10th in 2013. It was the year of the snake. </p>
