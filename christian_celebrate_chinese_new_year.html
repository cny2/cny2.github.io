        <h2><strong>christian celebrate chinese new year chinese new year chart of animals</strong></h2>
        <p>Being Chinese Christians, we should celebrate Chinese New Year to maintain our ethnic identity and heritage. But as Christians, our real identity is found in our relationship with God, our Creator and Maker. And thus, God must be the centre of our Chinese New Year celebration. So how can we celebrate Chinese New Year with a Christian perspective? 
Chinese lunar calendar. The Chinese generally have adopted the Western calendar since 1911, but the lunar calendar, based on astrology and the cycles of the moon, is still used for festive occasions such as the Chinese New Year. Astrology is one of China’s most ancient philosophies – perhaps more than 3,000 years old. 
Chinese New Year (CNY), also known as the Lunar New Year or the Spring Festival, is the most important of the traditional Chinese holidays. The date of Chinese New Year is determined by the Chinese calendar, based on a combination of lunar and solar movements. This is why CNY falls on a different date each year. This year, it falls on 12 Feb 2021. 
Of course, much of the traditions that come with Chinese New Year are also steeped in some form of superstition or religious practices. But that does not mean that we cannot bring Christ into the picture. Salt&amp;Light gives you five ways you can celebrate Chinese New Year in true Christian style while still honouring the culture. 1. 
The beginning of the lunar year has symbolised the act of starting over with renewed hopes for happiness and prosperity.

Chinese and many other Asian Christians continue to celebrate the New Year so as to maintain their ethnic identity. 
This is the legend of the Chinese New Year. However, the Lunar New Year date was fixed in the Han dynasty (about 202 BC–220 AD), with certain celebration activities becoming popular from then on. The custom of burning firecracker bamboo spread to the common people and has continued to this day. 
Chinese and many other Asian Christians continue to celebrate the New Year so as to maintain their ethnic identity. But while the celebration was traditionally marked by a religious ceremony in honour of Heaven and Earth, the household gods and ancestors, Chinese Christians will celebrate the event from the perspective of their faith in Christ.

First, the Chinese calendar is measured by different animals and this year is the year of the rooster and like the Jewish Passover Festival, Chinese New Year is based on the lunar calendar, not the solar calendar. This is why Easter falls on a different Sunday every year. During Chinese New Year, almost every home puts banners on their door. 
Chinese New Year (also called Lunar New Year, celebrated this year on February 5) is the largest holiday for many Asian peoples in terms of scale, importance, and family traditions. The name “Chinese New Year” can be misleading, as multiple Asian countries, such as China, Taiwan, Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Singapore and others, celebrate this

Rediscovering the Roots of Chinese New Year. Chinese New Year celebrations are believed to have begun as long ago as the 14th century BC. As such, a multitude of origin stories surround the many traditions associated with this festive occasion. These include firecrackers (to chase away the much-feared monster Nian), dragon and lion dances (to  
China’s Lantern Festival, or Yuan Xiao Jie, is another example. The festival began long ago as a religious observance but now is often seen simply as a new year’s celebration of traditional Chinese culture. There’s also the traditional Hawaiian hula dance, which began as a form of worship to Laka, the goddess of love, forests, and plants.
