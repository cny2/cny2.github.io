Its round shape and creamy texture are associated with abundance and good fortune in the coming year, making it a fitting choice for Lunar New Year celebrations. 
農暦新年快到，蒸糕糕！Go! Go! Go! 很忙呢！但是忙得來有美食，不錯喔！這個芋頭糕用的芋頭，是上一次做芋頭西米露的剩餘  
This savory dish, also known as taro cake or orh kueh, was a family favorite, especially during Chinese New Year. Mum would steam tender taro with dried shrimp and rice flour, then top it with crispy shallots, dried shrimp, and fresh green onions for a savory finish. A side of sweet or chili sauce brought everything together perfectly. 
Food often plays a huge part in a culture’s celebrations, and this Chinese taro cake, or woo tau goh (woo tao go) is no exception. If you are of Chinese descent and from my generation or earlier, you are, most likely, already familiar with this traditional Lunar New Year dish and hopefully, it conjures up fond childhood memories as it does  
Like another popular Chinese New Year snack, turnip or radish cake (Law Bak Gou 蘿蔔糕), this is made the similar way with rice flour, Chinese sausage, dried mushrooms, dried shrimps. Yet because taro is far more starchy than a turnip, the wheat starch added in this recipe would make the cake turn out somewhat elastic, balancing the floury  
Taro cake (traditional Chinese: 芋頭糕; simplified Chinese: 芋头糕; pinyin: yùtóu gāo; Cantonese Yale: wuhtáu gōu) is a Cantonese dish made from the vegetable taro. While it is denser in texture than radish cakes , both of these savory cakes are made in similar ways, with rice flour as the main ingredient. 
It’s still Chinese New Year celebration time until the 15th day of lunar calendar. We enjoy all the delicious snacks, radish cake (pressure cooker recipe), taro cake and Chinese New Year cake (steamed in a wok), especially when getting around with friends and family. You might find this CNY cake in Chinese dim sum restaurants all year long. 
Nian Gao (Chinese New Year Sticky Rice Cake) Nian gao is perhaps the most popular and well-loved dessert associated with Chinese New Year. I can never say no to this sweet and sticky rice cake!

Nian Gao Recipe Instructions. Prepare two 8-inch round baking pans by brushing the insides with vegetable oil.. Add 2 cups of water and the ginger to a medium-sized pot, bring it a boil, then let it simmer for 10 minutes over low to medium heat with the lid covered. 
Instructions: 1 Preheat 600 ml of cooking oil to 150°C, turn to medium heat, add in taro and sweet potato, fry for about 2 minutes until half-cooked, drain off the oil. 
Taro cake (芋頭糕 or 芋頭糍) is a southern Chinese steamed cake that you can often find in dim sum restaurants. Mama Lin’s taro cake is my absolute favorite. The cake is filled with earthy diced taro and topped with a mixture of ingredients that pack an umami punch: Chinese sausage, Chinese cured pork, dried shrimp, and dried scallops. 
The Taro and Coconut Chinese New Year Rice Cake is a creamy, satisfying dessert that combines the earthy sweetness of taro with the rich flavor of coconut. Its smooth texture and delightful taste make it a comforting addition to any New Year’s celebration, symbolizing harmony and family togetherness for the year ahead. 
Nian gao, also known as rice cake or New Year cake, is a traditional Chinese dish like turnip cake, taro cake, pineapple cake, braised mushrooms and sesame balls. It is commonly consumed during the Chinese New Year celebration. The name nian gao (年糕) is a homonym for "higher year" or "advancing year" in Chinese.

This concept was inspired by the "Braised Duck Leg with Taro" clay pot dish. Chef Hung incorporated this idea into the making of taro cake to introduce new flavors and characteristics into this traditional delicacy.
