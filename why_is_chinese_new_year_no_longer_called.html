        <h2><strong>why is chinese new year no longer called chinese new year 2025 how to say</strong></h2>
        <p>Why does Chinese New Year fall on different dates? Rather than following the western Gregorian Calendar with 365-day years, the Chinese New Year follows a lunar calendar based the moon's 12 phases. 
In contexts outside of China, referring to Lunar New Year as "Chinese New Year" and vice versa can come off as insensitive and offensive because it ignores other cultures, all of which have their own unique traditions, beliefs, and celebrations. 2. How each Asian country celebrates and names their New Year festival is different. 
Lunar New Year celebrations can last up to 15 days, starting on the new moon between late January and mid-February. The exact date varies each year based on the lunar calendar. The new year begins  
For Chinese people, Lunar New Year is the Spring Festival,  In Korea, the Lunar New Year is called Seollal; in Vietnam, Tet; and in Tibet, Losar. (Related: See Hong Kong like a Nat Geo Explorer.) 
Each year in January or February, Chinese communities and countries influenced culturally by China all over the world celebrate the festival that has come to be called the Lunar New Year. 
Layue (simplified Chinese: 腊月; traditional Chinese: 臘月; pinyin: Làyuè) is a term often associated with Chinese New Year as it refers to the sacrifices held in honour of the gods in the twelfth lunisolar month, hence the cured meats of Chinese New Year are known as larou (simplified Chinese: 腊肉; traditional Chinese: 臘肉; pinyin  
China wanted to do everything Western, so it celebrated the January 1 New Year. In fact, in 1949, the Communist Party forbade the celebration of the traditional Chinese New Year. However, by the 1980s, new Chinese leaders had a change of heart and allowed the celebration of the traditional Chinese New Year. 
“It’s called Chinese New Year,” one Twitter user replied. The British Museum subsequently deleted its tweet. On January 22, the first day of the holiday, it shared a new post with the image  
The last event held during the Chinese New Year is called the Lantern Festival, during which people hang glowing lanterns in temples or carry them during a nighttime parade. Since the dragon is a Chinese symbol of good fortune, a dragon dance highlights festival celebrations in many areas. 
Lunar New Year is the beginning of a new year based on lunar calendars or, informally but more widely, lunisolar calendars.Typically, both types of calendar begin with a new moon but, whilst a lunar calendar year has a fixed number (usually twelve) lunar months, lunisolar calendars have a variable number of lunar months, resetting the count periodically to resynchronise with the solar year. 
1. National identity and unity: Phibun believed that changing the name to Thailand would help foster a stronger sense of national identity and unity among the diverse ethnic groups living within the borders. 
Lunar New Year is all encompassing, a way to acknowledge other new years, not just the Chinese one. There is also Japanese New Year, Korean New Year, Japanese New Year, Tibetan New Year, and Mongolian New Year, and they are all on the same day as Chinese New Year. Edit: Why the downvotes? I didn't pull this out of nowhere. This is from Wikipedia. 
In the 1950s, Chinese linguists, led by Zhou Youguang, created a new system called Pinyin to improve the way Chinese sounds were written in the Roman alphabet. Pinyin, which means “spelled sounds,” was officially adopted in 1958 by the Chinese government. Unlike Wade-Giles, Pinyin used more accurate spellings based on Mandarin pronunciation. 
The ethnic Chinese community in Indonesia celebrates the Chinese New Year with age-old traditions passed down from their ancestors. Yet things take on an Indonesian flair as well, with differences found across the archipelago depending on the area the local Chinese immigrants originated from. 
The Chinese New Year begins with the new moon on the first day of the lunar year and ends on the full moon 15 days later. This period is filled with a plethora of traditions and rituals, each day  
In 2025, the Chinese Lunar New Year begins on Wednesday, Jan. 29, and lasts until the Lantern Festival on Wednesday, Feb. 12, with the rising of the full moon — this year called the “Snow Moon.” 
The Tang Dynasty period (618-907 AD) allows a change of paradigm in the Spring Festival celebration and the main function of the festival has also shifted.The festival was no longer perceived as a sacred ritual for the gods—which was the norm established for thousands of years—, and now the New Year was celebrated mainly as entertainment for both nobles and commoners. 
After Hong Taiji died, a prince named Dorgon assumed power. He was the new emperor’s uncle and controlled the government for 7 years. He helped conquer Beijing and drive Ming to the ground. During these years, he promoted the policy of enforcing the hair shaving. 
It started in China, calling the Chinese New Year, a "Vietnamese" New Year would be cultural appropriation. But then again, Zhao Tuo, or as known by the Vietnamese as "Triệu Đà", a Chinese general practically founded Vietnam as a state. 
In 2021, The Chinese New Year’s Eve was on February 11th, and the New Year was on the next day, February 12th, and the Chinese New Year Date will be on February 1st. The Chinese New Year Holiday falls around spring, and the spring festival is a national holiday in China, and spring is when the Chinese new year falls. </p>
