        <h2><strong>what to do in taiwan during chinese new year chinese new year celebration cards</strong></h2>
        <p>In terms of restaurants in Taipei during Chinese New Year, most really do close for New Year’s Eve and the first 2-3 days of the New Year. If you look hard enough, though, you can still find a few open, including most fast food chains. 
This year’s 2025 Lunar New Year sign is the snake – so Lunar New Year is referred to as the ‘Year of the Snake’ this time around. The year / animal changes each year, based on the 12 signs of the zodiac – so 2026 will be the Year of the Horse, and 2024 was the Year of the Dragon. 
Chinese New Year 2024 Holiday Dates. In 2025, Chinese New Year Day is on Wednesday, January 29. Everyone will be off work from Saturday January 25 to Sunday, February 2, which is nine days off. This year is a little interesting in that people will have several days off before the actual LNY date. 
During Chinese New Year, many cultural sites and museums offer special exhibitions and performances. Visit the National Palace Museum in Taipei to explore its vast collection of Chinese art and artifacts. In Tainan, the Confucius Temple hosts traditional music and dance performances, providing a deeper understanding of Taiwan’s cultural roots. 
Things to do during Chinese New Year in Taiwan Unlike many other regions that celebrate the Lunar New Year, Taiwan has very few events organized during this holiday. Some locals will make their way to a temple hoping to be one of the first to pray to the gods at the stroke of midnight, while others visit places of worship on New Year’s Day. 
Understanding the Significance of Chinese New Year. Chinese New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, is the most important holiday in Taiwan. It marks the beginning of the lunar calendar and is a time for family reunions, feasting, and honoring ancestors. 
Welcome to Taiwan, a land where ancient traditions meet modern vibrancy, especially during the Chinese New Year.This guide will take you through the heart of Taiwan’s festive celebrations, offering insights into cultural experiences, travel tips, and must-visit attractions. 
My brother came to stay with us last Chinese New Year (or Lunar New Year, but most Taiwanese people I’ve met call it Chinese New Year). I was a little apprehensive about finding things to do during the trip as CNY presents a unique challenge for visitors in that the first few days everything tends to be closed, and then the last few days everything tends to be overwhelmingly busy. 
2025 Taiwan Lunar New Year dates / Taipei Lunar. Lunar New Year in 2025 in Taiwan and Taipei falls on the 29 January 2025. Most Taiwanese and local people will be off the whole week from 25 January to 2 February 2025 and many escape the cities or leave home to celebrate with their families. 
Honestly speaking, the Gregorian calendar New Year is more of a commercial season for domestic and international tourists, and, loosely speaking, the Lunar New Year, aka Chinese New Year, which is especially noted among the communities of ethnic Chinese, is an important time for family members to get together and to indulge themselves in good food. 
In 2020, Chinese New Year’s Eve will be on Friday, January 24, and Chinese New Year’s Day will be on Saturday, January 25. The next four days, from January 26 to 29, are national holidays in Taiwan as well, while the festivities extend well into February 8. Taiwan’s Lunar New Year is quite different from the New Year celebrations in other  
In 2025, Lunar New Year’s Day falls on January 29 and the holiday will last from January 25 to February 2. This will not be an ideal time to visit. For the best information about this, see my guide to planning a trip to Taiwan during Chinese New Year and what will be open/closed in Taipei at this time. 
1/21 除夕 is like Thanksgiving or Christmas Eve, pure family time. Other than emergency service you will only have 24/7 convenience store open (required by the franchise); you might find some high end hotels serving New Year’s Eve dinner as well. 1/22 marks the new year. 
Before the New Year, a spring clean is a must.And while it helps to get rid of the junk collected over the year, there’s actually another more important reason for the annual pre-New Year clean up: the idea is that in removing old and unused objects, you’re making room for new luck in the coming year, and that by sweeping dust out the door and cleaning dirt off the windows, you are casting  
Lunar New Year is more than money in red envelopes or meeting distant relatives during the annual family get together. Just like how Christian faith has turned Christmas into such a family-centric holiday, Lunar New Year is rooted in Buddhist and Taoist traditions that similarly emphasize the significance of family reunions and ending and starting a new year together. 
I will link each aspect of Lunar New Year as the 15 days of celebration (Lunar New Year lasts for 15 days) goes by. Be sure to check back. Read about: Where to go for Lunar New Year? What to do on New Years Eve? What food to eat during Lunar New Year? Where to go to pray for love? academic? money? will update and link as each aspect gets  
7. Sending Chinese New Year Wishes. During Chinese New Year, Chinese people will greet each other with pleasant words like: 'Xin nian kuai le' which means 'Happy New Year' (simplified Chinese: 新年快乐). See more Chinese New Year Greetings and Wishes. 8. Watching the New Year TV Gala 
I strongly recommend visiting Taiwan during the 15th lunar day of Chinese New Year (Yuan Xiao) to enjoy the festive events and celebrations in Pingsi. Yuan Xiao is the only time of the year when lighted sky lanterns are mass released into the evening sky. 
Lunar New Year is a traditional holiday with Buddhist and Taoist roots. Visiting temples is a large custom during Lunar New Year. One of the biggest temples in Taipei City, Long Shan Temple was built in 1738 dedicated to Buddhist and Taoist gods. 
Taiwan CNY holidays will be from 8 Feb 2024 till 14 Feb 2024 . 9 Feb 2024 is Chinese New Year’s eve. Restaurants will be closed. </p>
