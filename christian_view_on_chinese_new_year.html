        <h2><strong>christian view on chinese new year chinese new year stockton</strong></h2>
        <p>Our Christian witness also includes being careful about our participation in the “vices” of Chinese New Year (gambling, excessive drinking, gluttony and revelry). Bearing in mind that our bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19), we should honour God by turning away from anything that infringes on biblical standards. 
Chinese lunar calendar. The Chinese generally have adopted the Western calendar since 1911, but the lunar calendar, based on astrology and the cycles of the moon, is still used for festive occasions such as the Chinese New Year. Astrology is one of China’s most ancient philosophies – perhaps more than 3,000 years old. 
Chinese New Year (CNY), also known as the Lunar New Year or the Spring Festival, is the most important of the traditional Chinese holidays. The date of Chinese New Year is determined by the Chinese calendar, based on a combination of lunar and solar movements. This is why CNY falls on a different date each year. This year, it falls on 12 Feb 2021. 
The Chinese New Year (CNY) is a widely celebrated cultural event around the world, especially in places with significant Chinese population. This festive occasion is steeped in symbolisms and traditions, such as the custom of giving red envelopes (hongbao) containing money for good luck or enjoying special foods which have auspicious meanings. 
Chinese across the nation are cleaning their homes and purchasing red outfits for their annual celebration of Chinese New Year. Despite China’s official adherence to atheism, most Chinese fully embrace Zodiac tradition. “The Chinese Christians, however, use this as a way to reach out to their communities, and to their friends and their families,” says Erik Burklin of China Partner. 
This is the legend of the Chinese New Year. However, the Lunar New Year date was fixed in the Han dynasty (about 202 BC–220 AD), with certain celebration activities becoming popular from then on. The custom of burning firecracker bamboo spread to the common people and has continued to this day. 
The beginning of the lunar year has symbolised the act of starting over with renewed hopes for happiness and prosperity. It is also a time to renew ties with family and friends, through family reunion dinners and social visits. Chinese and many other Asian Christians continue to celebrate the New Year so as to maintain their ethnic identity. 
In such an experience, "we become full of joy and hope for life, we are made new by the love of Christ, in the grace of God." Lent is "the time of preparation for the joy of Easter." And precisely, the time of the Chinese New Year, underlines Mgr Gan, is a golden opportunity to bear witness to the Catholic faith to and with one's family. 
Lunar New Year Practices &amp; Traditions. Many of the practices and traditions of Lunar New Year focus on how to bring peace and prosperity. The Evangelical Times article: “Chinese new year – a Christian perspective”, written by Jack Sin, expands on many of the common practices and traditions of Lunar New Year. You can read more in-depth  
Chinese Christians understand Jesus's seemingly contradictory directive. This Lunar New Year is the Year of the Snake. According to the Chinese zodiac, those who are born in this particular year  
Rev. Elijah from Shanghai believes that Christians should have a correct view of the Chinese New Year celebrations, away from the opinion that this issue is "untouchable". The pastor mentions that the older generation considers that no kitchen knife or cooking are permitted on the first three days of the Chinese lunar new year and bad words are  
The Tension of Chinese New Year. Although Chinese New Year is meant to be a time of celebration and joy, it can become a time of tension for Asian believers. Some Asian Christians have come to America from their home country (as students or people looking for a better life) and don’t know how to celebrate the holiday in a foreign context. 
Chinese New Year is a time of renewal and gratitude, making it perfect for sharing Christian Chinese New Year wishes. Whether blessing church members, children, or family, these greetings bring God’s love and peace. 
In a society where Christianity often runs counter-cultural, Chinese New Year is a particularly concentrated moment of trials. In this translated article from Christian Times, the author reminds Christians of what is most important when they return home for the New Year. Bring Your Family the Gospel When You Return Home at Chinese New Year 
Share your videos with friends, family, and the world 
Thus, with Lunar Chinese New Year around the corner, we know spring is approaching. But festivals primarily highlight meaning, that is, they remind us of some things that are important to our lives. The Lunar Chinese New Year is one such festival. If you are a Chinese, as you celebrate the festival, think about two things. 
The second day of the Chinese New Year is the day of cemetery visiting, and the main members of the whole family will go to the graveyard of their dead ancestors to burn "hell money" for them. It was just less than three years since his died, so it was even more solemn to go to the grave every year. 
As we welcome 2025, here are 120 uplifting Christian New Year wishes to inspire faith, hope, and love. These messages offer blessings, prayers, and encouragement for a joyous and spiritually enriching year ahead.
