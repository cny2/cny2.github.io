        <h2><strong>what is the difference chinese new year and lunar new year when is chinese new year moon</strong></h2>
        <p>Simply put, Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year are not the same. Despite being related, there are a few noteworthy differences between the two. Read on to find out what they are. The Differences between Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year 1. "Chinese New Year" is specific while "Lunar New Year" is more general. 
Chinese New Year specifically refers to the festival in China. Lunar New Year is a broader term for similar celebrations across Asia. Both are based on lunar calendars, but the Chinese calendar dictates the timing of Chinese New Year. 
Besides the wording, there are differences between Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year. Chinese New Year in China and Hong Kong includes events like parades, dragon and lion dances, as well as customs observed at work and within the family, like gatherings, giving red packets, decorating with specific flowers and fruits, and, of course  
The 24 solar terms are based on the sun’s position, while the date of the Spring Festival follows the lunar cycle, based on the moon’s phases. Therefore, Lunar New Year is a suitable translation for 农历新年 (the Lunar New Year). Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year offer two different perspectives: 
Chinese New Year is actually only one festival under the umbrella term of Lunar New Year, which is a festival that occurs on the first day of a new year in the lunisolar calendar, a calendar that  
The Differences between Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year 1. “Chinese New Year” is specific while “Lunar New Year” is more general. The term “Chinese New Year” specifically refers to the new year celebrations in China. It is deeply rooted in Chinese culture, history, and traditions, dating back thousands of years. 
The Tibetan New Year usually comes within a few days after the Chinese Lunar New Year and lasts about 3 to 5 days. During the festival, people will light bonfires, gather in a circle, and sing and dance to traditional music all night long on a square or spacious grassland. 
Among China’s traditional holidays and celebrations, none ranks higher in importance than the Lunar New Year (農曆新年). Also known as the Spring Festival (春節), or simply Chinese New  
You probably already know about Chinese New Year. Chinese New Year is a lunar new year celebration that’s similar to lunar calendars used by Tibetans, Hindus, certain Buddhist groups, and even one sect of Judaism. Lunar New Year is celebrated when the first new lunar cycle starts with a new moon. (A new moon is the absence of the moon.) 
Chinese New Year, also known as Spring Festival, is the New Year celebration specific to China. Culturally, Lunar New Year and Chinese New Year are celebrated in similar ways. 
The festival that is frequently referred to as ‘Chinese New Year’ is not only celebrated in China. The term ‘Lunar New Year’ is increasingly used to refer to festivals in other countries that take place at the same time and with many of the same trad 
As the Lunar New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, approaches, with the Year of the Snake from January 29 to February 12, 2025, it’s not uncommon for people to mix up Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year. These two terms are often used interchangeably, but there are subtle differences between them. 
What is Chinese New Year? Chinese New Year is based on the Chinese lunar calendar, which follows the phases of the moon and the solar terms. It usually falls between late January and mid-February  
If you are a cultural buff, it’s worthwhile to have a tour during Chinese Lunar New Year. See our sample tours for some inspiration.

The terms Lunar New Year and Chinese New Year are often used interchangeably. But it’s not the same. Although both celebrate the start of a new year according to the lunar calendar, they have different meanings, traditions, and cultural significance. 
That is because Chinese New Year goes beyond the commonly-known animal zodiac system and incorporates other cultural and religious elements from ancient Chinese culture.For example, Chinese New Year marks not only the change of the zodiac but the change of the heavenly stems (“天干”) and earthly branches (“地支”) — a unique way of  
Chinese New Year and the Vietnamese New Year (called Tết in Vietnam) actually have a lot in common. What we can be sure of is that Lunar New Year holidays are always about dedicating time for family, gatherings, gifts and hoping for the best for the New Year to come. 
What is the Year of the Dragon? Chinese New Year falls on the 29th January 2025 and marks the start of the Year of the Snake. The Chinese zodiac calendar is different from the Gregorian calendar in that it is a cycle of twelve years and each year is named after an animal. 
Lunar New Year, also known as the Chinese New Year and Spring Festival, marks the end of winter and the arrival of the spring season on the lunisolar calendar. Plus, it signifies the start of the  
The two celebrations are related holidays, with both of them marking the beginning of a new year, but 'Chinese New Year' is specific to New Years celebrations centred around Chinese culture.
