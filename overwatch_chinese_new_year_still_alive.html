The Year of the Dragon is here, featuring the return of fan-favorite Mischief and Magic prop hunt, past Lunar New Year game modes, new rewards, and all new skins in the shop. Read on to discover what adventures and rewards await when you log onto Overwatch 2. Prop Hunt Returns 
A new leak from a Chinese player gives us a good look at what some of Overwatch’s Year Of the Rooster skins are going to look like. This player found an ad for a “free week” for Overwatch to go alongside the Chinese New year event. The free trial is going to last from Jan. 24 to 31, which could be how long the actual event lasts. 
Here's to another year of epic ults, teamwork, and dominating the payload. Happy New Year, Overwatch family! Wishing every Overwatch player a year filled with clutch moments, impeccable aim, and many victories ahead! 
I'm Chinese and I'm not offended in the slightest. Hell, most characters have a Chinese themed skin. "Cultural appropriation" being offensive is a western idea. I'm perfectly chill with non Chinese enjoying the culture. That said there is a difference between Chinese and Lunar new year, but even that is only slightly irksome. </p>
