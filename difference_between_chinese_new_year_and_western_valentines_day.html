        <p>On Chinese Valentine’s Day, 七夕节/ 七夕節 (qī xì jié), newlywed couples celebrate their happy marriage. Also known as the “Night of the Seventh,” it falls on the seventh day of the seventh month of the Chinese lunar calendar. It outdates its Western counterpart by over 400 years! 七夕节 Chinese Valentine’s Day 
Stories of romantic love surround the history of both the Western celebration of romance as well its Eastern counterparts. Valentine’s Day originated as a Christian holiday honoring Saint Valentine. While the Chinese day of love, known as the Qixi Festival, celebrates the annual meeting of the Cowherd and Weaver girl in Chinese mythology. 
V alentine's Day and Chinese Valentine's Day, also known as Qixi Festival, are both celebrated as days of love and romance, but they have distinct cultural backgrounds, traditions, and histories. In this blog post, we'll explore the differences between these two love-centered holidays. ⚙Cultural Origins: 
In conclusion, Qingrenjie, also known as Chinese Valentine’s Day, is a significant cultural holiday in China that celebrates love and romance. Throughout this article, we have explored the origins and legends associated with Qingrenjie, as well as the various traditions and differences between Chinese and Western Valentine’s Day celebrations. 
Do you know the difference between Western and Chinese Valentine’s Day? Feeling pressure to drop cash on another romantic holiday so soon after the last one? Qixi Festival 七夕节 Qīxījié – often called “Double Seven” or “Chinese Valentine’s Day” – falls on the seventh day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar. Before  
Chinese Lunar New Year Vs Western New Year: the comparison mainly focuses on different time to celebrate the new year, various activities and respective meanings. The following discussion may help you get a better understanding of the differences between Chinese Lunar New Year and Western New Year. Time to Celebrate 
Therefore, on this day, the girls would offer the weaver girl various offerings and ask for weaving tips. The offerings were quite similar to that of Chinese New Year traditions. The couple would pray them, hoping their love would be as strong as Niulang and Zhinü. But nowadays, Chinese people celebrate this day just like Western Valentine’s  
The Chinese New Year technically begins on 初一 (chū yī) - the first day of the lunar year - and doesn't come to a close until 元宵节 (yuán xiāo jié) - the fifteenth day, also known as the Lantern Festival. That's fifteen whole days of celebration, so you could definitely say the New Year is a big deal in China! 
Although the western Valentine's Day on Feb. 14 prevails in China for years, Chinese people attach more and more importance to Qixi, their own Valentine's Day. Lovers and couples exchange gifts on that Chinese lovers day, and some youngsters like to join traditional activities in ancient Chinese costumes. 
They also celebrate love on Feb. 14 as well as the Lantern Festival (also sometimes called Chinese Valentine’s Day in English), which takes place over the Lunar New Year. But like the Western holiday, these days of love have become commercialized by hotels, chocolate companies, flowers vendors, and their ilk. 
Many people simply spend the Qixi Festival and Valentine's Day together, anyway, just be happy. However, what I want to say is that the Chinese "Chinese Valentine's Day" and the Western "Valentine's Day" are actually related and there are many differences. The connection between these two festivals is that Qixi Festival and Valentine's Day are  
Qixi, the night of Sevens, sometimes called Chinese Valentine's Day or Magpie Festival, the seventh day of the seventh lunar month is especially for lovers, like Valentine's Day. On this day, couples go to the temple and pray for their loved one and for a possible marriage. 
The Qixi Festival falls on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month in the Chinese calendar. This means that the date varies each year in accordance with the lunar calendar. Valentine's Day is celebrated on February 14th each year, so Valentine's Day is consistent globally. Customs and traditions: 
After living in China for 3 years as V-Trust Sales Manager and 1 year in Vietnam as V-Trust Country Manager, I am happy to share my experience and feelings, even if, for sure, I don’t know everything and they may not be exhaustive. Chinese New Year and the Vietnamese New Year (called Tết in Vietnam) actually have a lot in common. 
The Lunar New Year is traditionally a time for food, festivities, and family gatherings. It is celebrated in many countries, including China, Vietnam, Korea, Singapore, and Malaysia. 
On February 5, 2000, the Chinese will celebrate the beginning of the Year 4698, the Year of the Dragon. According to the Chinese Zodiac, romance and business will dominate the Dragon's agenda this year. 
Today, it shares similarities with Western Valentine's Day, with couples exchanging gifts, flowers, and love letters. Despite these changes, the festival's core values of love, devotion, and the hope for a reunion remain deeply ingrained in Chinese culture. 
There are numerous days for love in China throughout the year, but the biggest Chinese Valentine's Day is Qixi Festival. This is on the 7th day of the 7th month on the Chinese lunar calendar. The date therefore changes each year. 
There is a story to the Chinese valentine's day. I don't know the story for the western one (but i'm sure there is one, with St Valentine and all that) but now it is just commercialised to bits. The main point i'm trying to make is that there are two different stories, on two different dates, with the same theme. 
Nowadays, Chinese celebrate two Valentine’s Day, Western Valentine’s Day on 14 th Feb and Chinese Valentine’s Day on July 7 on Chinese lunar calendar. Western Valentine’s Day. Western “情人节(qíngrénjié) Valentine’s Day” will falls on 14th of February. Nowadays, Chinese people also celebrate this special day in various ways. </p>
