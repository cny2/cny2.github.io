        <p>Each Chinese lunar year has a Chinese zodiac sign animal. The Chinese zodiac year's stsarting date is a little different from the Gregorian year. It starts from Chinese New Year.

Today is Chinese New Year 2025, heralding in the Year of the Snake – the Wood Snake, to be exact. Lunar New Year isn’t just celebrated in China though, with countries such as Japan, Thailand  
The Vietnamese legend lacks a rabbit and the cat is able to swim, allowing it to take fourth place. [6] Cats hold unique spiritual and practical meaning in Vietnam. They are considered lucky, and help to ward off bad spirits. In the 2011 Year of the Cat, there was a baby boom recorded due to the association of luck with those born under this  
Let's delve into the numbers, particularly the surge in “dragon babies”. In 2024, during the Year of the Dragon, China witnessed a 5.7% year-on-year increase in births, with South Korea seeing a 3% rise. These spikes are noteworthy, considering both nations are grappling with declining birth rates. 
The New Year greeting in Chinese is ‘xin nian kuai le’, which literally means Happy New Year, but in Hong Kong and other Cantonese-speaking regions, ‘gong hei fat choy’ (or ‘gong xi fa cai’ (恭喜发财) in Mandarin) is more common—this translates to ‘congratulations on the fortune’! This is the most social period in China. 
An alternative version of the story says that Cat and Rat got as far as crossing the river together on Ox's head, but Rat pushed Cat into the water (and Cat was washed away and drowned or didn't get back to the Heavenly Gate in time to get a ranking). Effects of the 12 Chinese Zodiac Signs People's Personal Traits 
With Chinese New Year (or Lunar New Year) quickly approaching, some may wonder why this coming year is the Year of the Snake, why each year is represented by an animal and the story behind it all  
The Lunar New Year, or Spring Festival, marks the transition from one animal to the next—2024 is the year of the Dragon, which began on February 10th, 2024, and ends on February 24th, 2024. January 29th, 2025 (Chinese New Year) will signal the start of the year of the Snake.

In the following table, the years’ starting and ending dates are clearly shown which help you determine your animal sign correctly. 
Rat is the 1st animal in the 12-year cycle of the Chinese zodiac, coming after the Pig and before the Ox.Recent years of the Rat include 2020, 2008, 1996, 1984, 1972, 1960, and 1948, with the next Rat year in 2032 (Year of the Water Rat). 
The Cat and the Rat both decided to hop on the back of the Ox to make up for their poor swimming skills. However, midway through the river, the Rat pushed the Cat into the water.

Legends aside, the real origins of the lucky cat may actually be slightly sordid. Researchers from the University of California Irvine found that Meneki-Neko talismans suddenly became very popular in the Meiji Period (1868-1912) and it is believed that they were used to replace the phallic good luck symbols that were traditionally displayed in brothels after they were banned.
