In recent years some supermarkets have stayed open even on the first day of new year. The big shops will reopen on the second day, but some smaller stores and hawker stalls will stay closed longer.

There will be sporadic lion dances. 
Some smaller shops may be closed or holiday hours, and Changi Airport may be a bit crowded immediately before / after.otherwise, not much different. Just join in the fun with the celebrations.
