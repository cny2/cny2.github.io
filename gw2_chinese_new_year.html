47 votes, 20 comments. true. All Pieces of Unidentified Gear from Path of Fire. While its technically correct that Unid Gear is affected by Magic Find and the 15% extra buff from Lunar New Year will let you ID gear of a higher rarity more often on average, 15% wont do any significant difference to your average loot table of unid gear. 
Normally Lunar Near Year coincides with Chinese New Year (late January through mid-February), but its early this year. Lunar New Year is January 22 this year. It's early in GW this time because it's early for real as well.
