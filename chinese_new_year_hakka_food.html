        <p>Welcome to the Chinese year 4713 on the lunar calendar that begins on February 19, 2015. This is the year of the goat, (also called ram or sheep). Chinese celebrate for about two weeks with family reunions, festive banquets, symbolic decorations, red envelopes filled with money, and good wishes. 
(Hakka dialect) May you have a prosperous New Year! Chinese New Year arrives January 31 and families will gather for a special meal over the next two weeks. Many will eat traditional meals filled with foods that sound like fortuitous words or whose shape or color symbolizes prosperity, unity, wealth, fertility, family harmony, or good fortune. 
Hakka food in Hong Kong is represented by two different types of Hakka cooking, explains anthropologist Sidney Cheung of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. There’s the indigenous Hakka food, prepared by local Hakka people with ancestors who came after the end of the Coastal Evacuation (from 1662 to 1669) in the Kangxi period of the Qing

The Chinese New Year is called Ru Nian Jia (入年假) beginning December 25 of the lunar calendar. People begin cleaning their houses, making Fa Ban (steamed glutinous rice cake made with brown sugar), Tian Ban (sweet rice cake made with japonica rice), and all sorts of foods. On the morning of January 1, vegetarian food is ingested to cleanse  
This Hakka taro roll is a little-known recipe that you may only see around Lunar New Year. Julienned taro and a bit of ground meat are mixed with dried mushrooms, dried shrimp, Chinese sausage, and peanuts. The mixture gets rolled in tofu skin to hold it together, steamed, and pan-fried until crispy. 
Eating celery and garlic on New Year’s Day implies that one is hard-working and shrewd, while eating meat balls means laying the basis for a future relationship. Eating pomelo is meant to bring babies in the new year. Though usually frugal, the Hakka prepare a lot of food on Chinese New Year and festivals. 
Chinese Name: 猪肚鸡 zhū dù jī Flavor: salty and fresh Cooking Method: simmering It is a famous Hakka food. The pork stomach is stuffed in a whole chicken and simmered. The chicken and pork stomach absorb the flavor of each other during simmering. The chicken tastes tender and juicy and the pork stomach is chewy. 
Cantonese Specialties: Lap mei, nian gou and nose to tail dining “Festive dishes in the olden days are much simpler and did not have fancy names,” says chef Hooi Kok Wai of Dragon Phoenix. “in the 1950’s and 1960’s, most people could not afford to dine at restaurants, and going to one was a big deal.” 
A Traditional Hakka Delicacy: Hakka Braised Pork Belly, or known as Hakka Zhar Yoke 客家炸肉. Hakka Braised Pork Belly is a traditional and classic Hakka dish. It is also a dish often served during Chinese New Year or any festive occasions. This braised pork belly dish is characterized as salty, fragrant and umami. 
Possibly we may cook the famous Hakka Salt-baked Chicken (page 64) or some of the easier variations. For a special dish, consider making the Braised Chicken stuffed with Preserved Mustard Greens (page 233). Or maybe we’ll buy a Chinese roast duck. For me, Chinese New Year is about food and family.
