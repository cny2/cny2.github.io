        <p>The Overwatch 2 Year of the Snake event is well underway, so why not complete a bunch of the event challenges while donning some Lunar New Year skins? The game has had many Lunar New Year skins over the years, and 2025 brings both new ones and old favorites to the in-game shop. Read on for all of the currently available Overwatch 2 Lunar New  
We’ve rounded up the five best Chinese New Year events in gaming this year. Overwatch 2 (available until 3 February) The hero shooter Overwatch 2 is celebrating the Lunar New Year in 2025, as it does every year. This year, the hide-and-seek mode Mischief &amp; Magic will return to pit Rogues against Knights in a tense game of prop hunt. 
Season 15 also coincides with Overwatch 2’s much-anticipated return to the Chinese market, following years of absence due to publisher disputes. Now that Blizzard and NetEase have reached an agreement, Chinese players can once again access the game - and Blizzard is planning a range of exclusive rewards to celebrate the occasion. 
Overwatch 2 have released new cyberpunk skin recolors for Lucio and Widowmaker, and have also brought back more Lunar New Year content for D.Va, Genji, Ashe  
YEAR OF THE SNAKE BRINGS MISCHIEF AND MAGIC. Celebrate the Lunar New Year - Year of the Snake - in Overwatch 2 with the return of Mischief &amp; Magic, a festive game mode that blends strategy, stealth, and skill. This hide-and-seek battle pits Rogues against Knights in a thrilling showdown where every move counts. 
In Overwatch, the Lunar New Year cosmetics were cosmetics that could only be unlocked during the Lunar New Year event, either by logging in, completing limited time challenges, opening Lunar Loot boxes or purchasing them with Credits . In Overwatch 2, you can purchase any of the past event skins that were not part of weekly challenges from either the Hero Gallery with Credits and Coins (750  
The Lunar New Year event will help kick off 2025 in style. The Year of the Snake begins January 29, and the celebration in-game always falls at the same time. If we’re assuming that Overwatch 2 will maintain its nine-week long season schedule, then we can expect the Lunar New Year event to happen right in the middle of Season 14. The three  
Fireworks will fly as you play in these fun modes throughout the Year of the Dragon event. Complete Challenges for New Rewards. Year of the Dragon also brings new rewards and a bountiful amount of bonus XP to complete your Season 8 Battle Pass. Test your skills in Prop Hunt and complete games in Overwatch 2 to earn up to 50,000 bonus XP. 
The Lunar New Year is an annual seasonal event. The event is based on the real life Lunar New Year festival celebrated in several Asian countries, especially China. This event has exclusive cosmetics. Each event is named after the associated animal in Chinese zodiac. 2017: January 24 to February 13 (Year of the Rooster) 2018: January 8 to March 5 (Year of the Dog) 2019: January 24 to February  
Overwatch Lunar New Year is a grand celebration of culture and an event that’s dear to many team members. It’s also a chance for concept artists to tell stories through the skins they create, having designed skins in past years that represented characters from Wu Cheng’en’s Journey to the West , the Four Symbols , and the great lords of  
I t’s hard to stop making Overwatch comparisons to Marvel Rivals, given how familiar the latter’s upcoming Chinese New Year event looks. Those of us who’ve been playing Blizzard’s hero  
Each of the skins includes nods to traditional Chinese attire, and the event incorporates iconography befitting a celebration of the Chinese New Year which, this year, lands on January 29. 
Nearly every halloween one has a jack-o-lantern. Nearly every christmas one has X-mas lights or snow, and every chinese new years one has chinese fireworks/firecrackers. Seeing Hammond light up a x-mas "tree" or seeing Symm summon a hard-light Snowflake always looks off. 
One of the most fabulous events in Overwatch is back – the Lunar New Year celebrations. While other events have more appealing limited-time modes and special goodies, the New Year’s outfits, skins, and sprays have always included some fan favourites – and this season’s new additions are no exception to the rule. 
However, it's quite easy to track the decline in the quality of Overwatch’s Lunar New Year celebrations over the years. 2017 had the most Lunar New Year skins in the game, with thirteen new  
There are 210 Lunar New Year items (including 123 items from the 2017 series, 62 items from the 2018 series and 25 items from the 2019 series) which are comprised of: 27 Skins 8 Epic Skins 19 Legendary Skins 7 Emotes 19 Victory Poses 62 Voice Lines 67 Sprays 58 Hero Sprays 5 Common Sprays 4 Achievement Sprays 6 Highlight Intros +34 Player Icons. All items can be earned by opening special Loot  
Blizzard has revealed the Pale Serpent Widowmaker skin for the 2021 Overwatch Lunar New Year event. The seasonal Overwatch event occurs every year and seeks to celebrate the Lunar New Year, which marks the beginning of a calendar-based around cycles of the moon. This year marks the Year of the Ox. It is the fifth time that the event has

In Overwatch, the Lunar New Year cosmetics were cosmetics that could only be unlocked during the Lunar New Year event, either by logging in, completing limited time challenges, opening Lunar Loot boxes or purchasing them with Credits . 
Just like Overwatch, Marvel Rivals is celebrating the Lunar New Year with a limited event, and since the game thrives on cosmetics, they’ve also released a bunch of themed skins based on the holiday. While some skins are considered to be permanently in the shop, some are only going to be available for a limited time. 
Overwatch is going bigger with its Lunar New Year celebration this year in part because it’s coming back to China on Feb. 19, via publisher NetEase, no less. In a post last week on Xiaohongshu (also known as RedNote), game director Aaron Keller announced a bunch of returning cosmetics and a whole set of Chinese mythology-themed skins coming  </p>
