        <p>Each Chinese lunar year has a Chinese zodiac sign animal. The Chinese zodiac year's stsarting date is a little different from the Gregorian year. It starts from Chinese New Year. The Chinese zodiac years chart below is provided to help you find out the exact starting and ending dates of the Chinese zodiac years. (This is especially useful for  
Each person's zodiac sign is decided by their birth year. Traditionally, Chinese people believe that each zodiac sign has fated personality traits and each different zodiac year has a lot to do with personal horoscopes. Below is our Chinese zodiac calculator. You can use it to find out about your Chinese zodiac sign and discover your horoscope  
The Chinese New Year (Spring Festival) usually falls during 21 January and February 20, if your birthday is during this period in Gregorian date, you may belong to the zodiac sign of the last year. In the following table, the years’ starting and ending dates are clearly shown which help you determine your animal sign correctly. 
Rather than following the western Gregorian Calendar with 365-day years, the Chinese New Year follows a lunar calendar based the moon's 12 phases. Each phase cycle spans approximately 29 days with  
In Chinese astrology, a Lunar calendar is used, meaning the New Year corresponds with the first lunation of the year (usually in January or February). Here, your zodiac sign depends on your birth year. Babies born in 2025 will belong to the Wood Snake. The Snake will reign from January 29, 2025, to February 16, 2026. 
The Lunar New Year, or Spring Festival, marks the transition from one animal to the next—2024 is the year of the Dragon, which began on February 10th, 2024, and ends on February 24th, 2024. January 29th, 2025 (Chinese New Year) will signal the start of the year of the Snake. 
The chinese calendar, being a lunisolar calendar, has no fixed date to mark the beginning of a year. e.g., The date of Chinese new year in 2025 is January 28. So a person born before the chinese new year has different animal sign from those born on or after the chinese new year even if they are are born in the same year in gregorian calendar. 
Passing that day, a new animal year starts. Nowadays, the zodiac sign defined by lunar New Year’s Day is rooted in Chinese astrology culture, which is widely used in lucky date selection and love compatibility tests. If you have got your sign through the Chinese horoscope calculator, discover more about your Love Compatibility. 
Over 1 billion people celebrate the holiday, which marks the transition from cold winter to a season of renewal and ushers in one of 12 Chinese zodiac signs. 
The Chinese zodiac, known as Sheng Xiao or Shu Xiang, features 12 animal signs in this order: Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Sheep, Monkey, Rooster, Dog and Pig. 2025 is the Year of the Snake according to Chinese zodiac, starting from the 2025 Chinese New Year on Jan. 29th and lasting to 2026 Lunar New Year's Eve on Feb. 16. 2026 is the Year of the Horse.
