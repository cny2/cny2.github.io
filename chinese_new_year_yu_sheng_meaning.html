        <p>Chinese New Year is a great time to put away your diet plans and feast upon the festive goodies. Now, if you are familiar with the local Chinese customs, it is most likely that you have came across this rainbow-coloured dish, which is also known as Yu Sheng (鱼生), or better recognised as Prosperity Toss- Lo Hei (捞起) for the Cantonese. 
Today, the common form of yusheng is the qicai yusheng (七彩魚生; "seven-coloured raw fish salad") served in local restaurants during the Chinese New Year period.

Yu Sheng is usually served before any main dish. As an appetizer, it represents good for the brand new year.
