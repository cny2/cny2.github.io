        <p>Declaring Lunar New Year a federal holiday would be a powerful and uplifting way to do this!

At W.T. Clarke High School, Chinese New Year is not recognized as an official holiday for students. Students and their families that partake in celebrating this holiday find this highly offensive, for example in schools such as Syosset High School and Herricks High School have off for Chinese New Year. 
However, for the 2022-2023 school year, the NYC Department of Education (DOE) administration chose to remove Lunar New Year completely from the school year calendar.

In addition to the Chinese, there are a larger number of Asians that are of Chinese heritage and celebrate Chinese traditions. However, there is no right to take time off work to respect and observe the cultural custom of Chinese New Year, and we want the Government to give people of Chinese heritage a right to take leave on Chinese New Year. 
Lunar New Year is one of the most important holidays in many Asian culture, including the Chinese New Year（Chinese:春节），the Korean New Year (Korean: 설날; RR: Seollal), the Losar of Tibet (Tibetan: ལོ་གསར་), and the Tết of Vietnam, as well as the annual celebration in Okinawa, Japan.

The legal holiday is seven days long, from the Lunar New Year's Eve to the sixth day of the first lunar month. Some companies and public institutions enjoy a longer holiday up to 10 days or more, because in common knowledge among Chinese people, the festival lasts longer, from the Lunar New Year's Eve to the 15th day of the first lunar month (Lantern Festival). 
Public schools across the state will be celebrating the Lunar New Year on Jan. 29 as an official holiday for the first time. This also makes New York the first state to mandate school closures for  
For Chinese New Year in Singapore the decorations are beautiful; Chinatown is alive with red decorations,and massive zodiac animals for the appropriate year, it is a public holiday where those who celebrate are free to return to their homes and be with their families (family being a integral theme of Chinese New Year.) and live out the  
Governor Kathy Hochul today signed legislation to declare Asian Lunar New Year a public school holiday across New York State. Legislation (A.7768/S.7573) would ensure schools are not in session on Lunar New Year, underscoring Governor Hochul’s commitment to supporting and protecting New York’s AAPI community.

The 15th day of the new year is called the Lantern Festival, which is celebrated at night with lantern displays and children carrying  
We have off on Jewish holidays, so why not on Chinese New Year (61 signatures on petition) 
Nothing against Chinese new year being a holiday, which holidays they get are immaterial to me, but really the kids go to school from the first week of sept to the end of June. And each day off means one more day added tot he school year as they have to get a specific number of class days.
