        <h2><strong>chinese new year yee sang meaning chinese new year animals 1981</strong></h2>
        <p>Yusheng, yee sang or yuu sahng (Chinese: 魚生; pinyin: yúshēng; Jyutping: jyu4saang1), or Prosperity Toss, also known as lo sahng (Cantonese for 撈生) is a Chinese raw fish salad that is popular among the Chinese communities of Malaysian and Singaporean cuisine. 
We find out how yee sang came about and why this popular Chinese New Year dish truly beholds more than it appears. 
The prosperity toss, also known as yusheng/yee sang (translated as raw fish) or lou sang/lo hei (stir up), is incredibly popular in Singapore and Malaysia. Both claim to have invented the modern  
Today, Yee Sang is served on the eve of the Chinese New Year right through Chap Goh Mei (fifteenth day of the Chinese New Year). The restaurants have gotten really creative over the years. Apart from Yee Sang, which means “increase in abundance and vigor”, they also offer Pau Sang, with pau yee (abalone), meaning “guaranteed abundance and  
It is believed that the higher you toss the yee sang, the more your fortune will grow in the new year, so make sure to toss as high as you can! Besides the meaning of the dish as a whole, each component also has its own symbolism, which mostly boils down to the Chinese names of the ingredients being homophones for auspicious sayings. 
Yee Sang, also known as Yu Sheng or Lo Hei, is a vibrant and delicious salad that takes centre stage during Lunar New Year celebrations in Malaysia, Singapore and other parts of Southeast Asia. More than just a dish, it’s a tradition filled with symbolism, auspicious phrases, and communal joy. 
This is a dish that has many names – Yee Sang, Yusheng, Lou Sang, and Luu Sahng; and like its many monikers, stories of its origins are just as plentiful.One thing is certain: the yee sang is as synonymous with the Lunar New Year as red packets and lion dances are to the annual Chinese festivity. 
As Chinese New Year approaches, Malaysians across the country eagerly prepare to usher in the Year of the Dragon with vibrant festivities and delicious culinary traditions. Among these cherished customs is the joyous tossing of Yee Sang fondly called 'lou sang' (the act of tossing), a symbolic dish that holds deep cultural significance. 
Origins of Yee Sang. Yee sang (Cantonese, also transcribed as yusang), or yusheng (Mandarin), means "raw fish". The idea of having raw fish during the Lunar New Year apparently dates back to China over 2000 years ago, but it was initially a very simple dish. 
This salad, yusheng or lo hei in Chinese, is a must at Lunar New Year, the ingredients tossed for good luck. Where to eat it in Hong Kong. 
During the yee sang toss, the Chinese would shout out all sorts of auspicious wishes and hopes for the new year, including good fortune, health, happiness, more holidays etc etc. The Chinese also believe "the higher you toss, the more luck you get". 
Who Invented Yee Sang? There is much debate about where yee sang originated. Some people say Malaysia whilst others say Singapore. According to one set of claims, the Malaysian version of this Chinese New Year salad came about when a catering business owner from Seremban, Loke Ching Fatt, reinvented the traditional Chinese dish in the 1930s to save his business after it was hit from the  
Malaysian comedian Ronnie Chieng’s stand-up about Chinese New Year and the meaning of Gong Xi Fa Cai really sums up a large part of what this holiday is about. Variations for ingredients include red pickled ginger, sun-dried oranges, candied pomelo, jellyfish, five spice powder, or anything that can pass for symbolism and be deemed OK to put  
Lai Wah restaurant still claims that they were the “world’s first to serve Chinese New Year yee sang.” Image: cilisos.my Interestingly enough, yee sang (alternatively named Yu Sheng or Lou Sang), is most commonly practised during CNY only in Malaysia and Singapore, and is practically unheard of in other Chinese-populated countries. 
The nian gao, better known as tikoy in the Philippines, may be the most popular edible symbol of the Chinese New Year celebration, but the Yee Sang Prosperity Toss is fast becoming just as popular. 
There are a couple of theories about how yee sang became an integral part of the Chinese community’s New Year celebrations. The Malaysian version is that it was made popular by Loke Ching Fatt  
MODERN-DAY YEE SANG. In these modern days, many ingredients have been added to make the salad even more colorful. You will see meat and grilled fish added to it. Some only do fruit yee sang or vegetarian yee sang. I suppose the most important thing is to keep it colorful and to make sure you can grab the ingredients with chopsticks and toss it  
Penang hosted a mass Yee Sang tossing ceremony. In 2014, hundreds of locals and foreigners tossed Yee Sang during a Chap Goh Mei Festival which marks the 15th day of the Chinese New Year organized by the Penang Chinese Town Hall. 
He remembered that back in China, people used to eat Yusheng/Yee Sang to celebrate “ren ri”, the 7th day of Chinese New Year. It’s also known to be “everyone’s birthday” in Chinese culture. So, long story short, he invented his version of Yee Sang which has a close resemblance to the Yee Sang we know today. Only a close resemblance  
As the Chinese New Year draws near, families gather in anticipation of the most delightful tradition, the reunion dinner. Amidst the joyous laughter and delectable dishes, the star of the show is Yee Sang, which is also known as Lou Hei. </p>
