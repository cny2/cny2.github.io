The seventh day of the Lunar New Year (February 4, 2025) is said to be when the Chinese mother goddess, Nuwa, created humanity. Thus, it’s called renri/jan jat (the people’s birthday). 
The Lunar New Year marks the transition from one animal to another. The Year of the Dragon, which began on Feb. 10, 2024, ends on Tuesday. Wednesday begins the Year of the Snake.

Celebrated by millions around the world, this is a time for cultural traditions, family reunions, and hopes for good fortune in the coming year. In 2025, Lunar New Year falls on January 29, kicking off the 16-day Spring Festival.

Taking a bath in the middle of the night on New Year’s Eve, getting a haircut before the new year and the unacceptable act of sweeping the house during the first three days are all common Chinese New Year practices drilled into our minds. But among the younger generations, these customs are now more commonly attributed to old wives’ tales. 
The legal holiday is seven days long, from the Lunar New Year's Eve to the sixth day of the first lunar month. Some companies and public institutions enjoy a longer holiday up to 10 days or more, because in common knowledge among Chinese people, the festival lasts longer, from the Lunar New Year's Eve to the 15th day of the first lunar month (Lantern Festival). 
Chinese New Year kicks off every year after the second new moon of the Lunar Calendar. This year it falls between 29th January to 12th February. Lastly, for the Chinese, the Lunar New Year is sacred, it is a chance for families to come together and make unforgettable memories
