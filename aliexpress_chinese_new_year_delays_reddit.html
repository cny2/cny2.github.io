How to Avoid Chinese New Year Shipping Delays . Chinese New Year happens every year. As a result, retailers have time to prepare for the event and ensure that the business remains running smoothly. Below are a few suggestions on how to stay ahead of the rush: Plan Early; In avoiding Chinese New Year shipping delays, forewarned is forearmed, so  
Chinese New Year is the most important festival in China. CNY 2022 is on Feb 1. National holiday Jan 31 - Feb 6, and the festival will officially end on Feb 15. Even though it's still 2 weeks from now, the impacts has already started. Just several hours ago, the CNY travel rush has officially begun. 
Chinese new year is China’s biggest holiday period by a long way and not only is the shipping slow, but logistics in China comes to a complete standstill. The Chinese new year starts anywhere from late January until mid-February (It will differ every year). It runs for 15 days however some factories could possibly remain shut for up to 40 days. 
Discuss anything related to AliExpress. This is NOT the subreddit to just link to Aliexpress pages (unless you have a question about it). Instead post to r/alifinds. Looking for fashion reps, go to r/fashionreps. Looking for sneaker reps, go to r/repsneakers. Looking for Flash Sales go here. Looking for this week's most popular items to resell  
I've heard a lot about how Chinese new year will delay deliveries, but honestly I've ordered a couple of items at the start of february and they arrived in Europe faster than they normally would (didn't recieve them yet, but they are in neighbouring country). 
Chinese New Year - delays Hi guys, do you have any packages being delayed due to the Chinese New Year? Seller has asked me to wait another 10 days but I'm not sure how long the Dispute option will be active for.

This is where cultural and tradition difference really kicks in. I live at Asia country with majority is Chinese race. Chinese New Year is the MOST important event to the Chinese, maybe second to the National Day for those who are in China. During the Chinese New Year, it is their tradition to visit relatives and friends house. 
And it comes up every Chinese New Year, new folks asks about exactly this issue, and what they can do about it. The solution is simply not to start the venture so close to CNY, and source from a variety of suppliers instead of putting all their eggs in a single basket. 
Chinese New Year marks the turning point of the traditional lunisolar Chinese calendar – the new moon at the midpoint of the winter solstice and spring equinox. This year’s expected Chinese New Year falls on February 10, which precedes two weeks of Chinese New Year celebrations. Chinese New Year 2024 will begin on Saturday, February 10, 2024.

PSA: If you ordered from AliExpress - It's the time around chinese new year, expect delays This is very normal, similar to the time between christmas and new years in the US / EU. Normal business hours should resume the coming weeks. 
26 votes, 17 comments. true. During the past 12-15 days, which is the traditional Chinese New Year holiday, many AliExpress sellers have been on a break during this time (as most logistics services in China are also all on holiday at this time), so people will find themselves with orders that have not been shipped for a long time. 
Delay due to Chinese New Year is irrelevant in this case as the OP placed order over two Weeks before the start of the Chinese New Year. As the Delivery is expected on today and didn't arrive, the OP can open a Dispute for non delivery on the 13th. Somehow I have a strange feeling the OP will receive a strange surprise. </p>
