Celebrating the Chinese New Year. In Chinese-speaking countries, the Spring Festival (春节 chūn jié) is a general term used to refer to the festival season.This term is likely to replace the English phrase ‘Chinese New Year’ soon, given UNESCO’s recent decision to include chūn jié in its Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

The second day of the Chinese New Year is also known as “Kai Nian” in Chinese, meaning the beginning of a year.

Chinese New Year is a time of reunions between families, friends, and loved ones.
