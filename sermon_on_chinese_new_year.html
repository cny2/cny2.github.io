        <p>Chinese New Year even seems to have influenced New Year’s festivals outside East Asia, in countries such as Iran. Across over four thousand years Chinese New Year has picked up a series of legends and traditions, such as “Nien,” a ferocious dragon which, the ancient Chinese believed, eats people on New Year’s Eve. 
As Chinese Catholics, it is important that we continue to put God at the centre of our lives and existence, while at the same time, fully immersing ourselves in our rich history and culture, and this venerable and wonderful practice of observing the beginning of the new Lunisolar Year, the Chinese New Year. 
Chinese New Year (CNY), also known as the Lunar New Year or the Spring Festival, is the most important of the traditional Chinese holidays. The date of Chinese New Year is determined by the Chinese calendar, based on a combination of lunar and solar movements. This is why CNY falls on a different date each year. This year, it falls on 12 Feb 2021. 
We can give it to one another while reminding each other that success comes from the Lord (Psalm 75:6). As for Chinese New Year goodies such as barbecued pork, pineapple tarts (pineapple is called “ong lai” which means “may good luck come to our homes”), melon seeds, fizzy drinks, to name a few, let us remember to give thanks, enjoy them and eat them in moderation (1 Corinthians 10:31). 
Ancestors: While Chinese Christians will worship the one true God rather than their ancestors, that hardly means that they dishonour or neglect their family ancestors or even the ancestors of the faith. Scripture clearly calls us to respect those who came before us, and to honour our parents (Ex 20:12). Chinese New Year Prayer. Almighty God,

The Chinese New Year (CNY) is a widely celebrated cultural event around the world, especially in places with significant Chinese population. This festive occasion is steeped in symbolisms and traditions, such as the custom of giving red envelopes (hongbao) containing money for good luck or enjoying special foods which have auspicious meanings. 
Chinese lunar calendar. The Chinese generally have adopted the Western calendar since 1911, but the lunar calendar, based on astrology and the cycles of the moon, is still used for festive occasions such as the Chinese New Year. Astrology is one of China’s most ancient philosophies – perhaps more than 3,000 years old. 
For many of us, Chinese New Year is a time to relive rich memories of the past, celebrate the present, and hope for the future. In preparation for the festivities, we’re busy decorating our houses with red: red paper, red lanterns, red clothing, red firecrackers, and of course getting ready to hand our hong bao (red packets) full of money to  
The old has gone. The new is here” (2 Cor 5:17). A new life begins when our sins are washed away and we receive the new life that Jesus gives us. Hence, the Lunar Chinese New Year should remind Christians to put away sinful habits and live the new life, a life that is holy, filled with meaning that comes from living to please our Lord Jesus  
That is why Chinese New Year is celebrated on different dates each year, like Passover in the Jewish religion, and Easter in the Christian religion. Because of this way of dating, the beginning of Chinese New Year can fall anywhere between late January and the middle of February. Chinese New Year comes on Thursday, February 19, this year.

Across the last four thousand years Chinese New Year has picked up a series of legends and traditions, such as “Nien,” a ferocious dragon which, the ancient Chinese believed, eats people on New Year’s Eve.
