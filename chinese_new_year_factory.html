        <p>Factories shut down for several weeks, and after they reopen, it takes at least a few more weeks to get back up to full production capacity. Here we discuss the typical effects of the holiday and the actions you should take to avoid problems in your business. • When do Factories Close for Chinese New Year 2025? 
How Does Chinese New Year Affect Shipping? The Chinese New Year impact on shipping in 2025 will be more severe than in previous years, causing extensive delays and higher costs for businesses worldwide. With factory closures across China, production halts for weeks, leading to significant export backlogs and inventory shortages. 
Chinese New Year shutdown 2025 timeline. Chinese New Year Eve celebrations begin on January 28, 2025, so suppliers will begin slowing down or stopping production a week or so before. We recommend you ask your suppliers when their offices and factories will be closed throughout the holiday. 
There’ll be a China factory shutdown in 2025, but it’s the same shutdown that happens every year. The Chinese New Year holiday on the calendar lasts only 7 days, but the disruption it causes in manufacturing can last up to 40 days. So, when is Chinese New Year 2025? 
The Chinese New Year (CNY), also known as the Lunar New Year, is one of the most important holiday periods in global logistics. For businesses, it can present specific challenges due to factory closures, reduced workforce, and potential shipping disruptions. 
Chinese New Year 2025 presents challenges for businesses relying on Chinese suppliers, but proactive planning can help avoid disruptions. Place orders early, build inventory buffers, and secure freight services well in advance. 
Chinese New Year (Lunar New Year) 2025 Factories often close 1-2 weeks before Chinese New Year’s Day on January 29. They tend to reopen between February 19 and 25. 
Chinese New Year (CNY) is one of the most important holidays worldwide, especially in logistics and shipping. In 2025, the holiday season will affect production and shipping schedules significantly. From factory closures to port congestion, shippers must prepare for disruptions. 
Chinese New Year (CNY) is a critical period for businesses importing goods from China, as the annual celebrations bring the country’s manufacturing sector to a near standstill. With factories closing for several weeks, forward planning becomes essential to avoid supply chain disruptions. 
Other than the cultural and spiritual meaning the festival bestows to Chinese people, the 15-day long holiday (beginning with Chinese New Year’s Eve to the Chinese Lantern Festival) has a tremendous impact on the global supply chain, largely due to the uncertainty created by surging demand, decreasing manufacturing capacity, and the logistics

The Chinese New Year 2025 starts on January 29th and ends on February 12th. The Chinese New Year is traditionally celebrated for around 15 days, from the Chinese New Year's Eve to the Lantern Festival. Celebrations vary daily, but they all aim to welcome the upcoming new year. Some festivals during Chinese Lunar New Year are important: 
The 2025 Chinese New Year, also called the 2025 Chinese Lunar New Year, starts on February 28, 2025 and ends on February 31, 2025. Actually, traditional Chinese holiday activities often begin as early as one month before Chinese New Year's Eve and end at the Spring Lantern Festival. 
Note: We’ll use the terms Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year interchangeably. When is the Chinese New Year 2024? One of the most important traditional Chinese holidays, the Chinese New Year or Lunar New Year, is celebrated in several East Asian countries, including China, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, Indonesia, and North  
Even though Chinese New Year is only a seven-day holiday, companies should be aware that the production break for China-based suppliers, contract manufacturers and partners can last up to four  
With Chinese New Year a month away, many are getting ready preparing ingredients for meals, gifts for loved ones and buying festive treats.Much of the shopping can be done online, with some brands holding sales at their warehouses. 
It’s Chinese New Year, Curious George by Maria Wen Adcock, is a brand new book now available for pre-order, with a January 3, 2023 publishing date.The author is also known as the BilculturalMama, and she is a 30 Best Asian American Blogs and Websites Honoree. 
The Chinese factory floor workers often leave at least 2 weeks before the Chinese New year date and in some cases up to 4 weeks in advance as it is very difficult to get hold of “Train Tickets” during this time. The return date is normally linked to the “Lantern Festival” which comes 15 days after the Chinese New Year date. </p>
