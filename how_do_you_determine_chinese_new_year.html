The lunar calendar, unlike the Gregorian calendar, uses the phases of the moon to delineate days, weeks and months of the year. A lunar month is the period of time from one new moon to the next  
Because the Chinese calendar is based off the traditional lunar calendar and hence uses the moon's phases to determine time, the Lunar New Year often comes a bit later than the solar calendar’s  
Each person's zodiac sign is decided by their birth year.Traditionally, Chinese people believe that each zodiac sign has fated personality traits and each different zodiac year has a lot to do with personal horoscopes. 
Do you know which Chinese Lunar New Year animal you are? This week’s new moon, on Wednesday, Jan. 29, will signal the beginning of the Lunar New Year, which this year is called the “Year of the Snake.” It takes over from the “Year of the Dragon” in 2024 and precedes the “Year of the Horse” in 2026.
