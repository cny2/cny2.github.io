        <p>Very simply, Buddha's Delight, or jai (pronounced like "jye"), is a vegetarian dish known in Buddhist and Chinese cuisines and is traditionally served for the Chinese New Year holiday. Jai will vary slightly in ingredients and taste from one Chinese family to the next, with each mum or grandma having learned how to make it from a previous  
Most people call this vegetarian dish, “jai,” but you might know it as lo han jai, Monk’s food, or Buddha’s delight.

What is Buddha's delight? Hailing from the Buddhist practice of spiritual cleansing, Buddha's delight is a vegan dish that's traditionally served as the very first meal of the lunar new year (aka Chinese New Year).

The warmest New Year memory. Grandma’s recipe for Lo Han Jai means EVERYTHING to me. It’s part of our family’s unforgettable Chinese celebration menu that starts from the moment we wake up.

Long noodles symbolize longevity. Jade Dynasty Seafood Restaurant (1450 Ala Moana Blvd.) at Ala Moana Center serves a wide assortment of noodles, from beef chow fun (wide rice noodles) to crispy egg noodles. 
It’s strictly vegetarian food. The Taoist and Buddhist monks eat all forms of jai. Jai is a different form of cooking; when you say jai food, it’s vegetarian food.” Lee said jai varies from region to region in China. Northern Chinese jai is spicy with chiles and contains wheat gluten in place of out-of-season vegetables. 
Buddha's delight, often transliterated as Luóhàn zhāi (simplified Chinese: 罗汉斋; traditional Chinese: 羅漢齋), lo han jai, or lo hon jai, is a vegetarian dish well known in Chinese and Buddhist cuisine. It is sometimes also called Luóhàn cài (simplified Chinese: 罗汉菜; traditional Chinese: 羅漢菜).
