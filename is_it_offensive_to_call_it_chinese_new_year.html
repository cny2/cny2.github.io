        <h2><strong>is it offensive to call it chinese new year chinese new year rooster personality</strong></h2>
        <p>There is nothing wrong or offensive with saying Chinese New Year. However, if a person is referring to the New Year Celebrations taking place in all Asian countries or Asian communities throughout the world as “Chinese New Year” then this isn’t correct either. “Chinese New Year” should not be a blanket term used for this celebration  
State-run news agency Xinhua, for instance, hailed the celebration of “Chinese Lunar New Year” in Myanmar, Malaysia and Japan, emphasizing the use of “Chinese red” in decorations. 
Many Chinese social media users in China saw red when bubble tea brand Chagee used the term "Lunar New Year". Read more at straitstimes.com. 
So, Should We Call It "Chinese New Year" or "Lunar New Year"? In a casual conversation, there is no problem using the two terms interchangeably. Either way, whether you refer to it as the Chinese New Year or Lunar New Year, as long as no intentional offense is meant, it is safe to say that almost everyone will just be happy to share and  
Some call this holiday "Lunar New Year", as it reflects the start of an annual cycle determined by the moon's orbit of Earth. Others call this celebration "Chinese New Year" based on an argument that the holiday originated in China under its lunisolar calendar. However, other Asian cultures also celebrate holidays at this time of year. 
In contexts outside of China, referring to Lunar New Year as Chinese New Year can come off as insensitive and offensive because it ignores other cultures, all of which have their own unique  
In an online poll put up on Jan 24 on Weibo, 75 per cent of nearly 3,000 people surveyed as at Jan 27 said they will insist on referring to the festival as “Chinese New Year” and call out those who refer to it as “Lunar New Year”. 
Chinese New Year (let’s call it that to begin with) is the celebration of the start of the traditional Chinese calendar. In China, observances start on the eve of the first day of the year and continue until the 15th day of the new year, which is also known as the Lantern Festival. 
Saying ‘Lunar New Year’ may be more inclusive to other parts of Asia that celebrate the occasion, but is unnecessary when the context and the people addressed are clearly Chinese. 
在中文社交媒体上，把春节翻译成农历新年Lunar New Year还是中国新年Chinese New Year，正在引发一场争论。 有华人表示，应该尊重春节的文化起源，用  
Lunar New Year is a general term, Chinese New Year is specifically the start of the new year on the Chinese Traditional Calendar. It's not politically incorrect, just more specific. Reply reply 
Same with Chinese, Vietnamese, and Korean New Years. Greet a Korean Happy Korean New Year, a Vietnamese Vietnamese New Year, and a Chinese Chinese New Year Catch-all greetings are problematic. It homogenizes diverse communities. It is a "politically correct" way to lump diverse people into one mega-category. 
Why did the lanterns join a dance troupe for the New Year’s parade? They had some “light” moves to share! Giggle Details: Relationship Jokes. Chinese New Year Jokes For Kids. What do you call a rat who loves to nibble on snacks during the Spring Festival? A “snack-rodent”! Why did the dragon bring a sketchbook to the New Year’s parade? 
I've seen it being called Lunar New Year, but it seems to be synonymous with Chinese New Year when I search on Google. Both give the little fireworks animation. In any case I've never heard of it being racist unless it's a new frontier in racism. 
From poking fun at New Year resolutions no one plans to keep, to teasing the zodiac predictions that always sound suspiciously optimistic, Chinese New Year Jokes offer a hilarious twist to the traditions. Just be careful, once the laughter starts, it might echo louder than the firecrackers! Best Chinese New Year Jokes. Happy Chinese New Year! 
I also only learnt last year that it's called Lunar New Year but I KNOW a lot of people still (and don't even know that it's offensive) to call it Chinese New Year. I hope this doesn't become anything bigger than it needs to be. 
The fact is, the Chinese New Year — or the Lunar New Year — isn’t, strictly speaking, purely lunar. Many parts of the world celebrate the “Lunar” New Year 
ITs the same for other countries. Chinese are not native to Thailand or Philippines. But there is a large population of Chinese in these countries (started long long ago, just like how chinese from china arrives in MY/SG). Thats why is being celebrated and thats why its called Chinese New Year. Anyway, its actually wrong to call it Lunar New  
Chinese New Year is always a thrilling time — extended families gather to make fresh dumplings, welcome the fortune of a new year, and hand out red pockets. For many immigrant and diaspora families, this holiday season ties us to our culture through food, traditions, and reconnecting with relatives across the world. 
As you’d expect, no one in China actually calls it “Chinese New Year”; they either call the festivities Spring Festival or Lunar New Year. It’s a bit like how no one in China calls it Chinese food. Some countries, like Singapore and the US, call it “Chinese New Year” because the largest segment of their Asian population is Chinese. </p>
