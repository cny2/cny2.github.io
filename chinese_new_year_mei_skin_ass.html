        <p>Why didn’t Mei get a legendary skin for this event, you know, the Lunar New Year, the Chinese New year, the ONLY Chinese Hero? The one person who, understandably, would be the center focus of the event. But Mercy, the Swiss Heroine, the ethnical opposite of this entire event, got a legendary skin. Am I, like, missing something here 
Mei, being the only Chinese character in the game, got two skins for this event, two color variations of a traditional Chinese outfit that’s a bit less bulky than the huge jackets she’s worn  
Mei’s new Lunar New Year skins — Luna and Chang’e — appeared to give her a much thinner, unnatural-looking waist, Overwatch players noticed shortly after the update went live. 
Like most of Overwatch’s Lunar New Year skins, Mei’s outfits for the Year of the Rooster are great. They caused a slight stir earlier today, though, when people who had previously believed  
Blizzard’s super popular Overwatch is celebrating the Chinese lunar new year by having a Year of the Rooster event, giving characters custom themed skins relevant to the celebration including Sun 
The Lunar New Year event only has one new skin, a $10 Mei epic, which Overwatch 2 players aren't thrilled about. RELATED: Overwatch 2 Players Want A "Classic" Mode Inspired By The First Game What's more, this new skin is essentially a base recolour with a new hat, which isn't too surprising given that it's epic quality, but as it's the only new  
Let's delve into the numbers, particularly the surge in “dragon babies”. In 2024, during the Year of the Dragon, China witnessed a 5.7% year-on-year increase in births, with South Korea seeing a 3% rise. These spikes are noteworthy, considering both nations are grappling with declining birth rates. 
To this day, the Lunar New Year celebration is centered around removing bad luck and welcoming all that is good and prosperous. Red is considered an auspicious color to ring in the new year. In many Asian cultures, the color symbolizes good fortune and joy. 
The Lunar New Year event 2023 is here, and there are some enticing skins to add to your collection.  To nab yourself the newest Mei skin in Overwatch 2, you’ll have to collect your allowance  
Lunar New Year — which includes Chinese New Year, Seollal in Korea, Tet in Vietnam and more — begins on Jan. 29, kicking off more than two weeks of parties, customs and copious feasts.

New voice lines always come with legendary skins though so that's to be expected somewhat. While the snowman is cool, most people are disappointed because with winter time comes snow and snow is Mei's element. Lots of people had high expectations for Blizzard's icey-climate based hero to get an amazing new skin considering she didn't rec 
This is a list of all of Lunar New Year skins, along with any skin-specific voice lines that are attached to them. Unfortunately, there's not a lot of skin-specific voice lines for Lunar New Year skins so hopefully that changes a bit this year! Previous LNY skins.

Her chilly highness Mei-Ling Zhou is back once again, this time to share a cup of tea with you for Lunar New Year. Before starting up this pic, I was thinking of switching the view over to a frontal view, as opposed to a butt-shot like I did with A Warm Bath With Mei back in 2016. I also wanted the pose to be more relaxed and inviting to the  
In Overwatch, the Lunar New Year cosmetics were cosmetics that could only be unlocked during the Lunar New Year event, either by logging in, completing limited time challenges, opening Lunar Loot boxes or purchasing them with Credits . In Overwatch 2, you can purchase any of the past event skins that were not part of weekly challenges from either the Hero Gallery with Credits and Coins (750  
Lmao I'm Chinese and I didn't even know there's such a thing/belief. And I don't even care, now that I learned about it. Some of y'all need to calm down and stop being offended for us Chinese people. edit: New Mei skin is still #1. thicc thighs save lives 
They could release a skin honoring the year before (I know the season format changes from year to year but if it remained constant). So a skin commemorating the previous year's May Melee. Would be a good way to remember more history in a rapidly changing league, and to hype the tournaments themselves as distinct titles/events. 
This is the fourth time that Mercy got the Lunar New Year skin which is teased in Season 8 trailer. Currently, she has three Lunar New Year skins in the gallery (Fortune -&gt; Zhuque -&gt; Seolbim). Meanwhile OW1 OG characters such as Soldier:76 and Symmetra are still missing a Lunar New Year Legendary skin. 
People have been illustrating stylized female backs for as long as there's been art, however, there's a key difference to the location of that crucial 45 degree angle. If the "divot" was a little higher, it would look more akin to those image links. </p>
