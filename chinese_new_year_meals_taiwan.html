Having pigs in the home used to symbolize wealth, and the left radical of the Chinese character for pig (豬) can also be found in the character for house/home (家). Pork is also believed to make you stronger too.

Most Americans consider January 1 the start of the new year, but many Asians and Asian-Americans don’t. Instead, they follow Lunar New Year, also referred to as Chinese New Year in the U.S., which begins on January 29, 2025. (That’s the Year of the Snake in the Chinese zodiac, BTW.)
