        <h2><strong>what fish to eat on chinese new year chinese new year restaurant los angeles</strong></h2>
        <p>Eating two fish, one on New Year's Eve and one on New Year's Day, (if written in a certain way) sounds like a wish for a surplus year-after-year. If only one catfish is eaten , eating the upper part of the fish on New Year's Eve and the remainder on the first day of the new year can be spoken with the same homophonic meaning. 
Chinese New Year celebrations revolve around food and family Fish holds special symbolic importance and is integral to the traditional reunion dinner on New Year’s Eve The pronunciation of fish in Mandarin and Cantonese sounds like the words for “surplus” or “abundance”, so eating fish represents hopes for prosperity in the coming year. 
An Yan, China program director for the Marine Stewardship Council, says that serving a whole fish at the New Year's Eve dinner has a special significance.A whole fish "reflects the idea of  
You can’t have Chinese New Year without delicious dumplings! In 2025, dumplings still symbolize wealth, as their shape resembles gold ingots. The more dumplings you eat, the more money you’re said to attract. And if you’re lucky enough to find a coin hidden in one, it’s a sure sign that you’ll have an extra lucky year! 
Most Americans consider January 1 the start of the new year, but many Asians and Asian-Americans don’t. Instead, they follow Lunar New Year, also referred to as Chinese New Year in the U.S., which begins on January 29, 2025. (That’s the Year of the Snake in the Chinese zodiac, BTW.) 
Some rules of eating fish in Chinese New Year: 1. Don’t turn over the fish after you have finished eating one side. In Chinese culture, it means unlucky. 2. To show respect, the head of fish needs to be placed toward elders or distinguished guests. 3. 
1. Whole Fish – Abundance. A whole fish symbolises surplus and abundance for the coming year. The Chinese phrase “年年有余” (nián nián yǒu yú) translates to “may you have surplus every year.” Steam the fish with ginger and soy sauce to let its natural flavours shine. 
According to the Chinese, fish is one of seven lucky food to eat to ring in the new year. Whole fish dishes are especially more lucky than the easy-to-cook fillets. There are even tips on how to eat a whole fish right to ensure the new year is a prosperous one! If you’re looking to cook whole fish dishes this Chinese New Year, here are  
The typical blessing is 年年有余 (Nián nián yǒuyú), wishing you to have a surplus (or fish) of food and money every year. People will steam a whole fish for the New Year Eve’s dinner. Half of the fish is eaten for dinner, and the second half the next day. This is to prolong the surplus and make the future prosperous as well. 
Chinese people eat foods with the symbols of good luck, prosperity, and happiness during the Chinese New Year. The lunar New Year 2025 is coming, try these traditional dishes with auspicious meanings and have good fortune in the new year. 1. Fish - Fortune and Abundance 
Every year, people around the globe celebrate Lunar New Year, also known as the Spring Festival in China or, more commonly, the Chinese New Year (via Cnet).Legend has it that at the beginning of each year, a monster by the name of Nian, the Chinese word for "year," would come and eat villagers. 
Usually, it takes eight minutes for a smaller fish or 12 minutes for a bigger fish. According to Chef Leung Fai Hung, a fish weighing 1 catty (0.6kg) takes six minutes to steam, while a fish twice the size will take double the time. 
All over China, people have the tradition of having a lucky plate of fish on Spring Festival. In the south of China, the plate of fish is the last dish on the table at a Chinese New Year’s Eve dinner. People place it on the table, but don’t eat it. They keep the plate of fish through the New Year in hopes that it will bring them wealth. 
Eating an entire fish on new years symbolizes abundant food, money and luck for the new year. "You cannot cut [the fish]," Zhu said. "Have the whole fish on the table." 
Ai said one of the most common foods families make during Lunar New Year are dumplings, typically eating them on New Year's Eve. "The Chinese name of dumpling, jiaozi, basically means the turning  
The act of sharing and enjoying these delectable pockets during the New Year celebrations becomes a communal tradition that extends beyond culinary delight, fostering a sense of togetherness and the belief in the prosperous journey that lies ahead. 20. Niangao (Chinese New Year Cake) 
Because of this, eating fish for the Lunar New Year symbolizes a surplus of wealth at the end of the year. For the festivities, this Chinese New Year food — usually carp — are most often  
"Korean New Year’s Day, also known as Chinese New Year’s Day, is probably the biggest national holiday in Korea. Families and relatives get together to pay respect to their ancestors, eat lots of food, play traditional games and give gifts to each other. As a child, my favourite part of the day was receiving some money as a gift. 
1. Steamed whole fish. Fish is a homonym for abundance. It symbolizes the Chinese idiom "May you always have more than you need." When served with the head and tail intact, the fish carries an additional meaning: a positive beginning and end for the coming year. 
Lunar New Year is on the horizon, and you note that it is the biggest feast, the most family-filled, the loudest, the most festive, and the most delicious. This year, it occurs on January 29 and kicks off the Year of the Snake. Tell us a bit about how you prepare for the Lunar New Year in the weeks and days leading up to it. </p>
