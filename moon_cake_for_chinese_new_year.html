        <h2><strong>moon cake for chinese new year chinese new year bento set</strong></h2>
        <p>A mooncake (simplified Chinese: 月饼; traditional Chinese: 月餅) is a Chinese bakery product traditionally eaten during the Mid-Autumn Festival (中秋節). [1] The festival is primarily about the harvest while a legend connects it to moon watching, and mooncakes are regarded as a delicacy. 
For Chinese people (and many other East Asian communities), the new year, also known as Lunar New Year has just begun. Starting on February 12, the two-week celebration marks a time for new  
With the opening facing down, place the mold over a baking sheet. Press the handle to shape the cake. Then lift the mold and press again to release the cake. 🛎 NOTE: If your mooncake mold makes 100g mooncakes, double the dough and filling quantity for each cake. Also, you may use two salted yolks to make it extra luxurious. 
Storage Options: Room Temperature: Store in an airtight container for up to five days.(Using an air-tight container keeps the mooncake skin soft and prevents the sweet filling from drying out).

It yields a very tender dough (easy to work with, but slightly sticky) that yields a beautiful pattern after baking. (2) The single thing that matters most is the ratio of golden syrup to kansui. 
Each bite captures the essence of cultural heritage and family ties, making mooncakes a focal point of Chinese New Year celebrations. Whether filled with lotus seed paste or other delicious surprises (like chocolate!) - these round delights reflect the full moon, symbolizing hopes for a year filled with abundance and harmony. 
Hi Holly. Homemade moon cakes need to sit for about 1-2 days to soften. Initially, the dough will bake very dry and crumbly, but if you allow the cakes to sit for about 2 days the oil from the filling soaks into the dough and softens them. I typically put mine inside a tupperware to do this. They’ll get softer every day. 
To make some mooncakes, you’ll need 2 cups of lotus seed paste, 4 salted egg yolks, 1 cup of melon seeds, 1/2 cup of vegetable oil, 4 cups of glutinous rice flour, 1/2 cup of golden syrup, and 1
