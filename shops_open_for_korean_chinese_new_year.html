Answer 1 of 8: Hi, I would like to know any shops and restaurants open during Chinese New Year 2011 in Seoul as I will be visiting Seoul from 2 February till 6 February 2011. 
My friend and I are planning on visiting Korea in 2019, between Dec 20-Jan 2. I've tried looking at the websites for museums and such to see if they are open on Christmas Day or New Years Eve and have gotten mixed answers. Some say open 365 days and some will say closed for New Years day etc.

Will be traveling to Seoul from 19-27 Jan 2023, which coincides with Lunar New Year (22 Jan 2023). Will shops/restaurants be open during this period?

My advice would be to rethink your trip. Seollal is a major holiday in Korea. Tourist attractions such as palaces and N Seoul Tower are open as normal.
