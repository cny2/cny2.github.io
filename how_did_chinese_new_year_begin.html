        <h2><strong>how did chinese new year begin essay chinese new year open house</strong></h2>
        <p>Since the mid-1990s people in China have been given seven consecutive days off work during the Chinese New Year. This week of relaxation has been designated Spring Festival, a term that is sometimes used to refer to the Chinese New Year in general. The origins of the Chinese New Year are steeped in legend. One legend is that thousands of years  
In 1912, the government decided to abolish Chinese New Year and the lunar calendar, but adopted the Gregorian calendar instead and made January 1 the official start of the new year. After 1949, Chinese New Year was renamed to the Spring Festival. It was listed as a nationwide public holiday. 
Chinese New Year's Eve and the first 3 days of Chinese New Year; will be made up on subsequent working days if any of the 4 days fall on Saturday or Sunday. The day before Chinese New Year's Eve is also designated as holiday, but as a bridge holiday, and will be made up on an earlier or later Saturday. 
The first day on Gregorian calendar, the New Year's Day, was called Yuandan, while the first day on the lunar calendar was called Chunjie (Spring Festival), which is the present widely celebrated Chinese New Year. After 1949, the Spring Festival was listed as a nationwide public holiday, and people got days off work and school. 
In 1912, the government decided to abolish Chinese New Year and the lunar calendar. It adopted the Gregorian calendar instead and made January 1 the official start of the New Year. After 1949, Chinese New Year was renamed the Spring Festival. It was listed as a nationwide public holiday. 
While 元旦 (yuán dàn) would fall on January 1 of the Gregorian calendar, it is considered the official start of the new year. Nowadays, Chinese people will have a 7-day holiday from Chinese New Year's Eve (除夕 chú xí) to the sixth day of Chinese New Year. In 2023, the Chinese New Year holiday is from January 21st to January 27th. 
The traditions of Chinese New Year spread to these regions as a result of migration, trade, and cultural exchange over centuries. Vietnam, which was under Chinese rule for over a thousand years, celebrates Tết Nguyên Đán, which shares many customs with Chinese New Year such as ancestor worship, red envelopes, and lucky foods. 
Chinese New Year, also referred to as the Lunar New Year or the Spring Festival, is one of the most important traditional Chinese festivals and began around 3,500 years ago. This festivity is tied to the Chinese lunar calendar, and it originated as a time for feasting and to honor household and heavenly deities and ancestors. 
The date of Chinese New Year changes each year because it's based on the lunar calendar. While the western Gregorian calendar is based on the Earth’s orbit around the sun, the date of Chinese New Year is determined according to the moon’s orbit around the Earth. Chinese New Year falls on the second new moon after the winter solstice. 
Chinese New Year is the most important holiday in China. Tied to the Chinese lunar calendar, it begins on the new moon that appears between January 21 and February 20.  (140–87 B.C.), the  
dates of Chinese New Year, 1900-1999, along with the year's animal Jan. 31, 1900 was the first day of a year of the rat. Feb. 19, 1901 was the first day of a year of the ox. Feb. 08, 1902 was the first day of a year of the tiger. Jan. 29, 1903 was the first day of a year of the rabbit. Feb. 16, 1904 was the first day of a year of the dragon. 
The Year of the Dragon, which began on Feb. 10, 2024, ended Tuesday to begin the Year of the Snake. Snakes in Chinese mythology aren't manifestations of wickedness or evil as in Western cultures. 
The legal holiday is seven days long, from the Lunar New Year's Eve to the sixth day of the first lunar month. Some companies and public institutions enjoy a longer holiday up to 10 days or more, because in common knowledge among Chinese people, the festival lasts longer, from the Lunar New Year's Eve to the 15th day of the first lunar month (Lantern Festival). 
Honoring the dead is a Chinese New Year's tradition that's kept to the word. Many Chinese people visit ancestors' graves on the day before the Chinese New Year's day, offer sacrifices to ancestors before the reunion dinner (to show that they are letting their ancestors "eat" first), and add an extra glass and place it at the dinner table on New Year's eve.
