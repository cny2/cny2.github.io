        <h2><strong>difference between chinese new year and spring festival what animal was chinese new year 1981</strong></h2>
        <p>Among China’s traditional holidays and celebrations, none ranks higher in importance than the Lunar New Year (農曆新年). Also known as the Spring Festival (春節), or simply Chinese New  
In China, Lunar New Year is called Chūnjié (/chwnn-jyeah/), i.e. 'Spring Festival', or "Chinese New Year". It is well-known for starting a new sign in the 12-year cycle of the Chinese animal-zodiac. 
However, by the 1980s, new Chinese leaders had a change of heart and allowed the celebration of the traditional Chinese New Year. In 1996, China established a weeklong vacation called Spring Festival, allowing people to travel home to their villages to celebrate the Lunar New Year. 
The Lunar New Year — known as the Spring Festival in China, Tet in Vietnam and Seollal in Korea — is a major festival celebrated in several Asian countries. In Taiwan, this year, people have been drawn to the White Snake Temple to pay their respects. 
The Spring Festival is not just a Chinese celebration. It has become a global event. From lion dances in San Francisco's Chinatown to lantern festivals in London, the festivities transcend borders. In 2023, the United Nations declared the Lunar New Year an official holiday. 
In China, there is no difference between the Chinese New Year and the Lunar New Year. These two phrases both refer to the Spring Festival (春节 chūn jié). Chinese Lunar New Year is the 1st of the first month in the Chinese calendar . 
Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year are essentially the same holidays, celebrated by different names. The Lunar New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, is a traditional Chinese holiday that marks the start of the Lunar calendar and brings families together for feasting, gift-giving, and cultural activities. 
As a result of this difference, the Chinese New Year doesn’t happen on the 1st of January every year, but on the first day of the first month of the Lunar calendar, which falls on a different Gregorian date every year, but always between January 21st and February 20th. 
Chinese New Year, also known as Spring Festival or Lunar New Year, is the grandest festival in China, usually with a 8 days' holiday. As the most colorful annual event, the traditional CNY celebration lasts longer, up to two weeks, and the climax arrives around the Lunar New Year's Eve. 
Are Chinese New Year and Spring Festival Different? The simple answer is: no, these two festivals (in the right context) are the same. However, being that China is a multi-ethnic nation, there are also some points to keep in mind. 
On the 28th, 29th or 30th day of the new year, every household "posts the New Year's Red" (the New Year's Red is the collective name for the red festive elements pasted during the New Year, such as Spring Festival couplets, door gods, horizontal batches, New Year pictures, and the word "Fu"). 
SPRING FESTIVAL is called to the almost 30 days of first preparations to receive a New Lunar Year, the arrival of it, and 15 days later ending with Lantern Festival on lunar 15.' It consist of 8 days of preparations, followed by 15 days with each day dedicated to a special activity according to their customs, traditions and culture 
New Delhi: Chinese New Year, also called Lunar New Year or the Spring Festival, is an important festival celebrated at the beginning of the Chinese lunisolar calendar. The festival is believed to have originated over 3,500 years ago. It is important in Chinese culture as it marks the end of winter and the beginning of a new year. 
Chinese New Year, also called Spring Festival, is a common traditional festival for all Chinese people. In different areas and zones, people have their distinct ways to celebrate the most important festival, especially between north and south China. 
However, the Chinese Spring Festival, according to the Chinese law is to put 3 days off (New Year's Eve, the first day of the lunar year, the second day of the lunar year)——This also reflects the Chinese government's emphasis on and protection of traditional culture. 
After living in China for 3 years as V-Trust Sales Manager and 1 year in Vietnam as V-Trust Country Manager, I am happy to share my experience and feelings, even if, for sure, I don’t know everything and they may not be exhaustive. Chinese New Year and the Vietnamese New Year (called Tết in Vietnam) actually have a lot in common. 
White and black are typically used during funerals, so they are considered very unlucky colors to wear during Spring Festival. Arguing or swearing. Chinese New Year is a time for joy and laughter, and is seen as a time to set the tone for the rest of the year. So arguing or swearing is considered unlucky and should be avoided as best as possible. 
Chinese New Year, also well-known as Spring Festival, is definitely the biggest festival for Chinese people. Like Christmas, Chinese New Year has a splendid history and many traditions, which differ from any other festivals in the world. 
chinese new year是用非常英语式解释春节，因为大部分的美国人不知道“Spring Festival"是什么，可是听到“Chinese New Year"美国人可以猜出是什么意思，虽然大部分的人还是不了解具体的情况|spring festival is a direct translation of 春节, i presume this word isn't known to americans who live in predominantly non-Chinese communities. (less  
The terms Lunar New Year and Chinese New Year are often used interchangeably. But it’s not the same. Although both celebrate the start of a new year according to the lunar calendar, they have different meanings, traditions, and cultural significance. </p>
