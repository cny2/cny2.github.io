        <p>In the weeks leading up to Chinese New Year, there is an observable surge in shipping activity. Companies often ramp up production to stock goods before the holiday, leading to an increase in export volumes.

Chinese New Year can cause a disruptive effect on the shipping industry and global supply chains as certain countries temporarily shut down production facilities and operate transportation services with limited personnel. 
Chinese New Year (CNY) is one of the most important holidays worldwide, especially in logistics and shipping. In 2025, the holiday season will affect production and shipping schedules significantly. From factory closures to port congestion, shippers must prepare for disruptions.

Chinese New Year and shipping: 2023 recap. In December 2022, China announced the end of its strict Zero-Covid policy. Unfortunately, January 2023 came with a new wave of infections, with half to three-quarters of the labor force being unable to work. 
Chinese New Year starts on February 12 and lasts until February 22, 2021. This is the time of the year most businesses in China close down to celebrate. This has a lot of consequences for AliExpress shoppers and you should know about this: Feb 1: stores start to shut down and stop shipping orders. Between Feb 11 and Feb 22 most stores are closed. 
The weeks leading up to the Chinese New Year see a surge in shipping activity as businesses rush to meet export deadlines. This results in congested ports and higher transportation costs. After the holiday, the backlog at ports and customs can further delay shipments, creating extended delivery lead times. 
Chinese New Year, also known as Spring Festival, is the most important holiday in Chinese culture. It marks the beginning of a new year based on the lunar calendar. The date of Chinese New Year varies annually, typically falling between January 21 and February 20. In 2025, Chinese New Year will be on January 29.
