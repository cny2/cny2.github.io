The best time is like 3 weeks before the Chinese New Year holiday begins. All the locals are working overtime to make money and prepare for the long break, and no one is traveling yet. I went to the great wall during that time and there were 12 people there, 8 of which were in my group. 
Need to remember CNY is a biggest holiday for Chinese. This is the biggest mass transit in the world for 1 week. Billions only Chinese are traveling in and out of China.

The non-Chinese cultures borrowed it from Chinese culture, so Chinese New Year is what it was originally before other cultures started using it. Saying "Chinese New Year" is not a claim that only Chinese people can celebrate it. The acronym CNY is well-understood. LNY is not. (Try googling for each and see which one Google search specially  
I am sure there is a great fire works on Lunar new year 2sec day. It is 3 days to celebrate of Chinese New Year. The shopping mall might close, but there are restaurant are open and a lot activity you can do or seeing sight. the temples are pack of people, but the 1 Lunar New year, you must going to Sha-Tin to see the horse race.

The big dinner usually happens on new years eve (Jan 31) if you wanted to go that route. I would just invite a few friends over and have it be a dinner party. Wear red on New Year's day! 
Chinese New Year starts on February 12 and lasts until February 22, 2021. This is the time of the year most businesses in China close down to celebrate. This has a lot of consequences for AliExpress shoppers and you should know about this: Feb 1: stores start to shut down and stop shipping orders. Between Feb 11 and Feb 22 most stores are closed. 
We call it Chinese New Year but Lunar New Year in the broad sense if we’re talking to or about non-Chinese people. The Chinese in Chinese New Year refers to the culture which is among other countries like Malaysia and Singapore, it doesn’t refer to the country itself so idk why you brought that up.
