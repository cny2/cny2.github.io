One of my favourite Chinese New Year snacks. I have no idea why they are called love letters because the direct translation from Mandarin should be egg rolls. Maybe people in the past used to roll up love letters in these biscuits. Anyhow, to make these biscuits, you will either need the old school charcoal

Chai Choy” (Braised Mixed Vegetables) Later on in my adult years in Kuala Lumpur, my in-laws served Cantonese style Chinese New Year dishes on the morning of the first day with auspicious names like Ho See Fatt Choy, and Chai Choy that were very different from my childhood dishes but equally as tasty. 
It was during these visits that I noted the penchant among the Chinese to gamble during the Chinese New Year period, whether playing mahjong or cards. In fact, I would join in and place bets of five cents or 10 cents at the most at Kim Beng’s place, as I found out that it was not about the money but about the fun and camaraderie generated.
