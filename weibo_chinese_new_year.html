Chinese New Year has arrived. It is the most important Chinese festival of the year, and the anticipation starts weeks before it starts. Trending topics on Sina Weibo during this period include “going home”, “not able to go home”, “meeting the family-in-law” or “red envelope” (hongbao, monetary gifts during festivities). 
Chinese social-media users are worried that families will stop gathering during the Lunar New Year. The hashtag "#Nobody's visiting relatives in 20 years" has received 340 million views since Tuesday. 
For an article What’s on Weibo did about this issue in 2014 (see: Rent-a-Date and Chinese New Year), we found that it was possible to go on Taobao, China’s largest e-commerce platform, to look for a partner to rent. This year, this is no longer possible. 
The House of Harry Winston celebrates the Chinese Year of the Dragon with an exceptional timepiece. For 2024, the Chinese New Year will be welcomed in a luxurious rose gold case distinguished by its crown graced with a pearl at noon. Gleaming with the brilliance of Harry Winston diamonds, the case frames a dial decorated with the figure of an imperial red dragon cavorting in dreamy white

Peak Time wants to provide opportunities to groups that have been hit hard by the pandemic, are not as well-known due to taking long breaks or experiencing frequent member changes, have disbanded or recently debuted and need a boost of publicity, or want to showcase  
As the Chinese New Year approaches, the age-old tradition of setting off fireworks and firecrackers has once again become a topic of heated discussion.
