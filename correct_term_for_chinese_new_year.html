        <p>Chinese bubble tea brand popular both in and outside China, found itself in hot water when it used the term “Lunar New Year”. ST PHOTO: YEW LUN TIAN UPDATED Jan 28, 2025, 03:49 PM 
Why does Chinese New Year fall on different dates? Rather than following the western Gregorian Calendar with 365-day years, the Chinese New Year follows a lunar calendar based the moon's 12 phases. 
Layue (simplified Chinese: 腊月; traditional Chinese: 臘月; pinyin: Làyuè) is a term often associated with Chinese New Year as it refers to the sacrifices held in honour of the gods in the twelfth lunisolar month, hence the cured meats of Chinese New Year are known as larou (simplified Chinese: 腊肉; traditional Chinese: 臘肉; pinyin  
In recent years, the topic of correct terminology of the Chinese New Year celebration, has unfortunately been creating controversy. Some claim that referring to the celebration as 'Chinese New Year' may be insensitive, as there are several other cultures celebrating the same festival by a different name on this date, and so it is not strictly  
Celebrating the Chinese New Year. In Chinese-speaking countries, the Spring Festival (春节 chūn jié) is a general term used to refer to the festival season.This term is likely to replace the English phrase ‘Chinese New Year’ soon, given UNESCO’s recent decision to include chūn jié in its Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. 
Chinese New Year specifically refers to the festival in China. Lunar New Year is a broader term for similar celebrations across Asia. Both are based on lunar calendars, but the Chinese calendar dictates the timing of Chinese New Year. Each term has cultural significance, but Chinese New Year is the more commonly used name. 
Chinese New Year is actually only one festival under the umbrella term of Lunar New Year, which is a festival that occurs on the first day of a new year in the lunisolar calendar, a calendar that  
In more modern terms, the first day of the Lunar New Year falls on the second new moon after the winter solstice (in the northern hemisphere) of the preceding year. 
Restaurants are closed, but leading up to the New Year, tuck into heaping plates of dumplings (饺子, jiao zi)—which sounds like 交子 (jiāo zi); the second symbol, 交 (jiao) means "exchange  
This shift is partly driven by efforts from countries such as South Korea and Vietnam. Both nations have long-celebrated lunar new year traditions, but have increasingly pushed for the use of “Lunar New Year” to distance themselves from the Chinese-centric framing. While “Chinese New Year” remains the most common term, its growth rate  
Some say Chinese New Year, and others say Lunar New Year. But, in contrast to the first two examples, did you know that Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year don’t actually mean the same thing? Reader: *gasps* Different Dates. For one, depending on the country in which it’s celebrated, the Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year can have  
If you look up the Wikipedia page for Lunar New Year and compare it to the page for Chinese New Year, the page for Chinese New Year is at least five times longer, despite being the less general event. But generalizing Lunar New Year as Chinese New Year is more than just saying the wrong word and using the wrong name. 
Similarly we can't wish "Happy Chinese New Year" to Koreans, Vietnamese, and any other non-Chinese ethnic groups celebrating New Year on January 22, 2023. "Lunar New Year" is incorrect because traditional Chinese calendar is not lunar, it is lunisolar where sun's position is factored too. 
"On Chinese New Year" if you are talking about the day. But you can use "At Chinese New Year" if you're talking about an event. So you would say "I clean my house ON Chinese New Year." But if you were asking a friend if you'll see them at a party, you could say either "Will I see you AT Chinese New Year?" OR "Will I see you ON Chinese New Year?" With "at" it's implied you mean "At THE Chinese  
Lunar New Year is a general term, Chinese New Year is specifically the start of the new year on the Chinese Traditional Calendar.  The correct terminology is now  
The terms Lunar New Year and Chinese New Year are often used interchangeably. But it’s not the same. Although both celebrate the start of a new year according to the lunar calendar, they have different meanings, traditions, and cultural significance. 
Clyde: You are correct, Chinese New Years (CNY) lasts 15 days and yes they would wear new clothes for the duration of the festival. We can say "at" but I agree "on" would be more likely to be said, however since the festival is so long during is much better. 
Last week, K-pop singer Danielle Marsh asked her online fans what they were doing for Chinese New Year. A profuse apology followed two days later, in which she promised to “try to be more  
The Differences between Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year 1. “Chinese New Year” is specific while “Lunar New Year” is more general. The term “Chinese New Year” specifically refers to the new year celebrations in China. It is deeply rooted in Chinese culture, history, and traditions, dating back thousands of years. 
In China, only Chinese celebrating the New Year, hence they call it Chinese New Year or Spring Festival. 春节。 In Vietnam, they call it Tet. In Korea, it is Seollal (설날)。 In Singapore and Malaysia, it is Chinese New Year or 华人新年。 I'm celebrating my own festival and I call it whatever I want. Enough of this lunar new year shit. </p>
