        <p>The date of the festival was set in the Han Dynasty (202 BC - 220 AD). Also known as the Lunar New Year, the celebration takes place at the beginning of the new year on the Chinese lunisolar calendar.

Chinese New Year. Mike Harney Spills the Tea: Ask Mike Anything. 5 comments. Barbara Haymann-Diaz. July 6, 2023 at 1:32 pm.  Forever Grateful for Harney and Sons Tea! 
Green Tea with Coconut, Ginger and Vanilla is weirdly a go to Christmas tea for me! The Barnes &amp; Noble near my college always had it in stock for the holidays. Their seasonal teas like Valentine's Day and Lunar New Year are ones I always keep in stock, weirdly good and addictive.
