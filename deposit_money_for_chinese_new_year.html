        <p>The date we’re looking at this Chinese New Year 2025 is 4 Feb 2025. But wait! There’s more. It’s not good enough to simply deposit cash at the ATM any time on 4 Feb 2025, OTOT (own time, own target). You need to time your cash deposit perfectly in order to maximise your chances of “good fortune”. 
You might not know it by name, but perhaps you’ve noticed snaking queues at cash deposit machines on a particular day during the Chinese New Year (CNY) period. That date is called Li Chun. 
When is Li Chun this year? This year, Li Chun falls on 4 Feb 2024. However, it’s not just about going to the ATM on February 4, 2025. To really maximise your chances of “good fortune,” you need to time that cash deposit just right as the ideal timing varies depending on your Chinese zodiac sign. 
Here’s the ultimate guide to depositing your money during Li Chun 2025 based on your Chinese zodiac sign. When is the Most Huat Time to Deposit Your Money? The most auspicious hours to deposit money for all zodiacs other than rats, oxes and dogs, the above will be 4 February 2025, from 1pm to 2.59pm. 
In the Year of the Wood Snake, Li Chun is observed on the seventh day of Chinese New Year. In the past, people used this day to appeal to the gods for favourable weather conditions and a bountiful year of harvest ahead. In modern times, many practise depositing money into bank accounts on Li Chun, believing it brings them good fortune. 
The auspicious hours to deposit money span from 11:00 pm on 3 February 2025 (Monday) to 7:00 pm on 4 February 2025 (Tuesday). Each zodiac has different auspicious hours. You can refer to the table below and head down to the nearest POSB, UOB, OCBC or other banks’ ATM to deposit money. Expect a huge crowd between 1pm to 3pm on Tuesday! 
Although we celebrate Chinese New Year on 10 February according to the Gregorian calendar, li chun – which falls almost a week earlier – is the date in the lunar calendar that “officially” marks the start of spring. Written as 立春 – which literally translates to “to start” and “springtime, youth, or joy” – it is linked  
Li Chun (立春) falls on 4 February 2025. It signifies "the Beginning of Spring", and is the start of a new Chinese solar year. Here is the ideal time to deposit money for good luck, according to your zodiac sign. Have you ever noticed snaking queues forming at banks and ATMs on a particular day around Chinese New Year? 
Best timings, according to your Chinese zodiac. According to Way Fengshui, 2024's forecast makes 11am to 1pm on 5 February the best time to deposit money for all zodiacs, except those born in Ox, Snake, Monkey and Rooster years. 
This occasion is known as Li Chun (立春) to the Chinese – marking the beginning of Spring. This year, Li Chun starts on the 3rd of February and ends on the 18th of February. There is a belief that banking your money on the first day of Li Chun will boost your wealth and luck for the new year. 
As Chinese New Year approaches, many look to auspicious dates and times to attract good fortune. For business owners, choosing an auspicious time to start work is believed to bring extra luck throughout the year. Meanwhile, for the rest of us, selecting the right moments to deposit money can set the stage for a prosperous Year of the Snake. 
Amidst the flurry of getting ready for the upcoming revelries – cleaning the house, buying new clothes, preparing the angpows – remember to also save the date for li chun, which falls on 4 February this year (almost two weeks after the first day of Chinese New Year)! 
Li Chun is a date on the Chinese calendar that marks the beginning of spring. It often falls around the same time as Chinese New Year, although the dates can vary — Chinese New Year might actually come before or after Li Chun. This year, Li Chun begins on 3 February 2025, at 10.10pm. 
To further help Indonesians step into the new year on an auspicious note, Wise, a global technology company building the best way to move and manage the world’s money, has teamed up with a renowned Feng Shui expert Grand Master Hillary Phang of Yuan Zhong Siu, to provide readings on the 12 Chinese Zodiac’s financial health for 2025 timings to deposit money.
