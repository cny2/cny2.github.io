Our Rookie's Guide to Yu Sheng this Chinese New Year. Everyone stand around for the Prosperity Toss. We demystify our favourite part of Chinese New Year! Posted by Honeycombers on Friday, February 9, 2018 
Yusheng, the popular dish of raw fish and vegetables, is a staple of Chinese New Year. It is an opportunity for friends, family and colleagues to usher in good luck and prosperity together with auspicious phrases and yusheng sayings. 
Don't forget to use these auspicious phases when tossing your Yu Sheng during the Chinese New Year! With Chinese New Year just around the corner, now might be a good time to introduce your little ones and involve them in the yearly customs and traditions of the festival. Let's start with a very Singaporean tradition, Lo Hei, or tossing the Yu  
1. Arrange raw fish slices: Nian nian you yu Auspicious meaning: “Abundance over the years! Prosperity every year!” or "May every year come with ample surplus!" 2. Add dried orange peel, pomelo or lime: Da ji da li Auspicious meaning: “Great luck and great prosperity!” 3. Add pepper and seasoning powders: Zhao cai jin bao 
Lo hei or yusheng is a Chinese New Year tradition. This dish, along with the auspicious sayings or words that accompany it bid good tidings for the year ahead as everyone “tosses up the good fortune” together. 
Chinese New Year is a great time to put away your diet plans and feast upon the festive goodies. Now, if you are familiar with the local Chinese customs, it is most likely that you have came across this rainbow-coloured dish, which is also known as Yu Sheng (鱼生), or better recognised as Prosperity Toss- Lo Hei (捞起) for the Cantonese. 
Yusheng (鱼生) on the other hand, means an “increase of abundance”, as the word yu (鱼) sounds like yu (余) which means abundance and surpluses while the word sheng (生) sounds like sheng (升) which means to rise. Yusheng is made up of 11 ingredients, each of which have different auspicious meanings which are spoken as each item is added. 
Everyone stands with chopsticks ready and tosses the ingredients into the air while saying auspicious sayings like “Huat” and “Lo hei”. Repeat seven times (or more) and toss extra high for better luck. Happy Chinese New Year, everyone! This article was originally written by Sheralyn Loh in 2018 and updated by Amanda Broad in 2025. 
Lo Hei (捞起) is a Chinese New Year tradition in Singapore and Malaysia, involving the communal tossing of a raw fish salad called Yu Sheng (鱼生). The term “Lo Hei” means “tossing up” or “stirring up” in Cantonese and symbolises prosperity, abundance, and good fortune. 
To me, one important part of celebrating the Chinese Lunar New Year is the tossing of Yu Sheng or Lou Hei. According to traditions, the tossing of Yu Sheng is traditionally done on the 7th day of the Lunar New Year, however many Chinese restaurants offer this joyous dish throughout the entire 15 days. 
There is another specialty food for Chinese New Year celebration: Yu Sheng. It is often served as part of a multi-dish dinner, usually as the appetizer due to its symbolism of “good luck” for the New Year. 
When putting the Yu Sheng on the table, there’s a ritual where it’s accompanied by New Year greetings such as 恭喜发财 Gong Xi Fa Cai meaning “Congratulations for your wealth”, 万事如意 Wan Shi Ru Yi meaning “May all your wishes be fulfilled” said verbally, followed by declarations of more good wishes associated with what the ingredients symbolize. </p>
