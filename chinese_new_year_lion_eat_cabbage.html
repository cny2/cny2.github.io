        <p>If there is a significant or notable person in the audience, the lion will also bow three times to that individual. Finally, after the dance is over, the lion will once again bow three times. 3. The Secret Behind the Biting. If you’ve ever attended a lion dance, you probably have seen—or experienced—a lion bite by-standers. 
If you’re lucky enough to attend a Chinese New Year celebration, you may have the chance to view a lion dance. Likely dating back 2,000 years to the Han Dynasty period of Chinese history, the dance is a spectacular, high-energy affair, with performers in bright lion costumes leaping and twirling to the sound of loud drums and cymbals, dancing to bring good fortune in the new year. 
Choy cheng in Chinese basically means “plucking the greens”. The greens in a lion dance are a physical head of lettuce. However, the symbolism goes far behind some discount produce you can find at Costco. The Chinese language is full of puns and wordplay, especially when it comes to things like good luck, wealth, and happiness. 
Why Do the Lions Eat Lettuce? Lettuce is the staple food of lions in Southern Chinese Lion Dancing. The reason for this, as is common with symbolic foods in Chinese culture, the phonetic associations of the word "lettuce" in Chinese. "Sang Coi" (cantonese) is an adjective-noun construction which literally means "raw vegetables". 
Think of bok choy and the phrase often heard around this time of year 'gung hay fat choy' which essentially means 'wishing you great happiness and prosperity.' "When you hang up lettuce you want to make the lion happy," says Quon, who's also the chief dance instructor for the club. In Chinese tradition the lion can bring luck, he explains. 
People perform lion dances at Chinese festivals or big occasions to bring good fortune and chase away evil spirits. The lion dance is one of the most important traditions at Chinese New Year. It is performed to bring prosperity and good luck for the upcoming year. The lion dance is also a way to create a festive atmosphere and bring happiness. 
Over time, this evolved into the lion dance that we know today. In traditional Chinese culture, lions represent power, wisdom, and superiority, and they are believed to bring good luck. This is why lion dances are performed at key events, especially during Chinese New Year, to usher in happiness, health, and success for the coming year. ‍ 
The pronunciation of the word “lettuce” in Chinese is similar to the word for “wealth” or “get rich,” so “catching” or “eating” the lettuce during the lion dance performance is thought to bring wealth and prosperity. The lion dance is said to have originated from a legend about a small village being attacked by a lion.
