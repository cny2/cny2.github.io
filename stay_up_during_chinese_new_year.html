        <h2><strong>stay up during chinese new year when does chinese new year end 2025</strong></h2>
        <p>Chinese New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, is a time of joy, celebration, and cultural traditions. Among the many customs observed during this auspicious occasion, one stands out as particularly significant: staying up all night, known as "shousui" (守岁) in Chinese. 
Lunar New Year falls somewhere between Jan. 21 and Feb. 20, though the exact date varies year by year. Traditional festivals, such as Chinese New Year and the Mid-Autumn Festival, follow the  
This year the Chinese New Year falls on February 12. Celebrating Chinese New Year’s Eve has always been a family matter in China, it is the reunion day for every Chinese family. It is the most important time. Wherever they are, people are expected to be home to celebrate the festival with their families. The Chinese New Year’s Eve dinner is  
The date of the Chinese Lunar New Year is determined by the occurrence of the second new moon after the winter solstice. The winter solstice occurs annually on either December 21 or 22. The Chinese people have very rich traditions for their New Year. 
There's this tradition among the Chinese that you should stay up to welcome the new Lunar New Year. It comes from this phrase "守岁" (shŏu suì). When translated to English, 守 means "to watch", while 岁 means "year" or "age". The belief is that the later you stay awake, the longer your parents will live. 
Staying up late on the eve of Chinese New Year is said to bring longevity to one’s parents. The later you stay up, the longer they will live. In some households, children even stay up through  
The Gala starts at 8 pm and ends when the Chinese New Year arrives at midnight. Singing, dancing, cross talk, sketch comedy, and acrobatics are always seen in the Gala. 8. Staying up late on the Chinese New Year's Eve. Staying up late is said to bring longevity to one's parents. 
Let's delve into the numbers, particularly the surge in “dragon babies”. In 2024, during the Year of the Dragon, China witnessed a 5.7% year-on-year increase in births, with South Korea seeing a 3% rise. These spikes are noteworthy, considering both nations are grappling with declining birth rates. 
The countdown to the Spring Festival usually starts on the 23rd day of the twelfth month of the lunar year, when Chinese people get busier with preparations for the festival and observe traditional folk customs in the country. On Lunar New Year's Eve, Stay Up All Night. The 30th day of the twelfth lunar month is called Chinese New Year's Eve. 
Staying up late on New Year's Eve: It's a tradition to stay up late on Chinese New Year's Eve, called "守岁" (shǒu suì), to protect and bring longevity to one's parents or elderly family members. Giving red packets : Red packets, or "hongbao" (红包), containing money, are given to children, unmarried adults, and senior members of the  
But here’s the twist – once the New Year kicks in, housework takes a back seat. It’s a break from the broom for a week, all in the name of preserving that festive luck. 6. Mind Your Words: Taboos and Conversational Etiquette. Kids will be kids, right? But during Chinese New Year, a little reminder goes a long way. 
The timing for putting up Chinese New Year decorations varies but is typically done a few weeks before the actual Lunar New Year’s Day. People start to decorate their homes and public spaces 3 to 4 weeks before the beginning of the festival, creating a vibrant and festive atmosphere. 
10. The “no cleaning” rule during CNY. In Chinese tradition, cleaning during the new year is believed to sweep away wealth and good fortune. Even taking out the garbage is seen as tossing out prosperity from the home. So, yes – this gives you the perfect excuse to put off housework until after Chinese New Year. 
To avoid its attack, people should shut doors and stay sober. When staying up all night, people will find something to kill the time, such as chatting, watching TV, playing cards or mahjong. It is really difficult to stay awake for a whole night, so Chinese people are beginning to abandon this Chinese New Year tradition. 
Before the New Year arrives, every home should be spring-cleaned from top to bottom – and your children can help out in this too! After that, house cleaning (or any sort of housework) is frowned upon during the New Year holiday, because the Chinese believe that this is tantamount to sweeping away any good luck. 6. Watch Your Tongue Boy! 
To usher in the new year, the Chinese wear new clothes and sometimes sport fresh hairdos. 5 As cutting one’s hair is seen as cutting off one’s luck, people choose to get a haircut before Chinese New Year. Thus many local salons usually charge a premium for services during this period. 6 Chinese New Year’s eve 
Chinese cities are generally less busy than normal during Chinese New Year. So many people are not native to the large cities and they travel to their hometowns during this time. That said, you live in Beijing anyway, so there isn't much appeal in just hanging around here. My recommendation would be to travel internationally. 
The Chinese New Year’s Eve dinner is a family reunion dinner, and this is the most sumptuous and important meal at the end of the year. 5. Stay up Late or all Night on New Year’s Eve. Staying up late for the new year coming in is one of the New Year’s Eve events with a long history. 
Some of us stay up late during CNY Eve, and when asked, the common answer is that the longer you stay up, the longer your parents will live. But it’s actually an act that stems from Chinese lore. As the story goes, villagers back then would stay up late to keep a watch for the monster Nian during CNY Eve, and to keep themselves occupied, they
