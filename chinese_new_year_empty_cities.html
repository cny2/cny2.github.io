        <h2><strong>chinese new year empty cities chinese new year celebrations sunnybank</strong></h2>
        <p>According to statistics reported by the Beijing Morning Post, the number of empty apartment properties that are sitting in these Chinese ghost cities may be as high as 50 million. This estimate was supplied by the State Grid Corporation of China, based on the number of apartment buildings that have been completed but have not used electricity  
While information about them is scarce, studies have identified some 50 municipalities of varying sizes, often labelled as development areas (开发区), new areas (新区), or eco-cities (生态城). They are often located on the outskirts of second and third-tier Chinese cities; most are fully completed, but some were suspended mid-construction. 
Media outlets often label underoccupied development areas in China as "ghost cities" or "ghost towns". [9] [10] However, the two terms are technically misnomers since these terms describe places that previously had economic activity but have since become defunct and abandoned, while many underoccupied developments in China are new installations that have yet to receive residential occupation. 
The Story of China’s Ghost Cities and Its 65 Million Empty Homes. There is a ghostly London, Manhattan, and Paris lying within China. Published: Oct 29, 2021 10:40 AM EST 
The Scope of China’s Ghost Cities. Across China, over 50 major cities and urban developments remain largely uninhabited. These are no small projects. For instance: Ordos City’s Kangbashi District: Planned to house one million residents, but only about 100,000 live there. 
Kangbashi, located in Inner Mongolia, is often considered the archetypal Chinese ghost city. Designed for a staggering one million residents, it famously struggled to attract even a fraction of that number in its early years. Images of deserted avenues and empty apartment blocks cemented its reputation as a deserted city in China. 
During normal times, cities tend to be measurably warmer than surrounding rural areas. But during Chinese New Year, the temperature difference narrows by around a third, the study found. Scientists examined satellite data and on-the-ground temperature data from 31 cities between 2017 and 2019, finding that urban temperatures fell by 0.63  
From empty skyscrapers that tower over The Shard in London, to enough empty apartment floor space to entirely cover the city of Madrid – this is the story of China’s ghost cities. Over the past fifteen years, China has constructed hundreds of new cities, urbanised hundreds of millions of people, and completely changed the way in which the  
In 2020, the Chinese government took action to try to deflate China's unsustainable housing bubble by restricting the amount of money larger developers could borrow. After years of overbuilding and excessive borrowing, this triggered the beginning of the end for some of the country's largest property companies. 
In his annual new year speech, Chinese President Xi Jinping trumpeted the city’s progress saying it was "growing fast” and helping to revitalize northeastern China. | REUTERS Bloomberg 
What to Expect in China During Chinese New Year? Empty Cities. Many Chinese people have immigrated to the country's 1st and 2nd tier cities (such as Beijing or Shanghai) from 3rd tier or rural areas, so during the holiday time, they typically return home. This leaves the big cities nearly empty in the days before and after the holiday. 
Need to remember CNY is a biggest holiday for Chinese. This is the biggest mass transit in the world for 1 week. Billions only Chinese are traveling in and out of China. Few countries recognize CNY official holiday. I believe Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia are national holidays. SE Asia thrives on Chinese tourism. 
Chinese New Year is near; the poor can't afford to go home; cities and towns are empty everywhere
