        <p>People born in the year of 1936 (Jan. 24, 1936 - Feb. 10, 1937) or 1996 (Feb.19, 1996 - Feb. 06, 1997) which is Bing Zi Year are members of the Fire Rat. For those born before Jan. 24, 1936 or Feb.19, 1996, they belong to the zodiac animal of Wood Pig. 
Fire Rat is very independent and loves to compete madly. It does not suit ordinary life. If one day success passed her, the second time she will not miss her chance. The fire appeared after the heat was born in the southern part of the sky and, having fallen to the Earth, impregnated it. 
Rat is the 1st animal in the 12-year cycle of the Chinese zodiac, coming after the Pig and before the Ox. Recent years of the Rat include 2020, 2008, 1996, 1984, 1972, 1960, and 1948, with the next Rat year in 2032 (Year of the Water Rat). 
1996 is the year of the Rat according to Chinese zodiac. Furtherly based on Chinese Five Elements, the year 1996 belongs to the Fire. Therefore, people born in 1996 are the Fire Rat.

Years of the Fire Rat: Those born in 1936 and 1996 are Fire Rats. The next occurrence of the Fire Rat will be in 2056, following the 60-year cycle of the Chinese Zodiac. Individuals born in these years share the core traits of the Rat, enhanced by the fiery, energetic influence of the Fire element. 
The Wood Rat is ranked first in the 60-year Chinese zodiac-element cycle. By five element theory, each 12-year zodiac cycle has an element, producing: Wood Rats, Fire Rats, Earth Rats, Gold (Metal) Rats, and Water Rats. 
If you were born in one of the these calendar years, your Chinese zodiac sign is probably the Rat, and in China you would be known as a Rat. However, the Chinese zodiac year is usually said to start from Chinese New Year, which ranges from late January to mid-February.

Rat year (1948, 1960, 1972, 1984, 1996, 2008, 2020) is the 1st Chinese zodiac year. People with Rat sign are alert, delicate and get a quite good fortune in 2025. 
There will be some new opportunities for the Rat people to make money in 2025. The Rat people have a certain investment vision, so the income will increase.
