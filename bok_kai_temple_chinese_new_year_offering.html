        <h2><strong>bok kai temple chinese new year offering chinese new year 2025 traditions</strong></h2>
        <p>Celebrate the 140-years-plus Bok Kai Parade! The heart of the festival is the now-restored Bok Kai Temple, built in Marysville, California's historic Chinatown in 1888. The popular parade, some say the oldest continuous one in California, features a variety of floats, cultural performances, and, of course, the famous Bok Kai parade dragon! 
The Soon family, particularly sisters Helyn and Mable, have been dedicated VOLUNTEER caretakers of the temple for many, many years, graciously administering the requirements of worshipers, working diligently to insure the safety and quality of experience for any and all visiting the temple. After the lunar New Year and the yearly Bok Kai  
The only Taoist Temple in the United States with Bok Eye, the water god, as its central deity. Home to the only rare exterior murals depicting Chinese cultural traditions of their kind. Help us protect and preserve culture for future generations. Join us march 9-10 for Bok Kai weekend 2024 
Now, every year since 1880, Chinese Americans from all over the country—but especially from the Bay Area—travel to Marysville to join the Bok Kai festivities. The Chinese American Pioneer Heritage Committee, a group formed by many Bay Area Chinese American leaders, including former Oakland Mayor Jean Quan, has led a group that’s come to  
Today, the history of Chinese settlement in Marysville and the legacy of Bok Kai continues to be celebrated during an annual, weekend-long festival that happens 30 days after the Lunar New Year. 
The Bok Kai Temple (Chinese: 北溪廟, literally North Creek Temple) is a traditional Chinese temple in the city of Marysville, California, located at the corner of D and First Streets. Since 1880, it served as the center of what was a bustling Chinatown for a small town known as the "Gateway to the Gold Fields". [ 3 ] 
Unsurprisingly, the temple was built along the Yuba River, prone to excessive flooding in the 1800’s until the current levee network was built. Today, this temple is still active, and on the weekend closest to the second day of the second month of the Chinese New Year, the Bok Kai parade and Bomb Day is held. 
The Bok Kai Temple is a historical site that brings hundreds of worshipers each year hoping for a bountiful harvest. On the day of the parade the 175 foot Dragon works his way down the parade route to end at the temple with hundreds of firer crackers going off. 
Site dedicated to the restoration and preservation of the Bok Kai Temple of Marysville, California. Provide information about the cultural significance of the Bokkai Temple. Provide information regarding the Chinese community in Marysville. Provide information for contacting the organization. Provide information regarding the projects relating to the preservation efforts. 
People came from as far away as Los Angeles to celebrate the Chinese New Year on Friday at the Bok Kai Temple in Marysville. 
Today it houses a wide collection of texts and artifacts, including the body of the first Bok Kai parade dragon Moo Lung and the second Bok Kai parade dragon Kim Lung. The Chinese School Located 226 First Street in Historic Marysville, California, opened in 1940 and operated through the mid-1970’s.

From the crowning of the Bok Kai Parade Hostess to the Parade and community festivities that culminate in Bomb Day, our community comes together to celebrat 
The Marysville Chinese Community had a vision for many years that was finally realized with a 2016 Kickstarter campaign. Since then, volunteers with the Marysville Chinese Community have continued the work that ensures the artifacts will be available for public viewing in the museum, located within the Bok Kai Temple. 
He's been crated and preserved in the Bok Kai Temple by the Marysville Chinese Community. Age has taken its toll on the material which made up the elongated body of this once proud and colorful mythical serpent, which was crafted by artisans in China before 1900 and shipped to Marysville at the cost of between $5,000 to $6,000. 
We rely on the support of community partnerships to continue our preservation work at the Bok Kai Temple, The Bok Kai Temple Museum, and the Historic Marysville Chinese School Museum. We are excited to present the 145th Annual Bok Kai Day Celebration and Bomb Day, March 1-2, 2025. 
Bok Eye, according to the Chinese, means Northern or Dark North (Bok) and God (I or Eye). The first Bok Kai Temple was built nearly two blocks upstream on the Yuba River from the present structure. It was appropriately named the Bok Kai Mui, which means Temple (Mui) of the North (Bok) side of the stream (Kai). 
The Bok Kai Temple is the only temple in the United States that still celebrates Yee Yeut Yee or Bomb Day, a celebration dedicated to Bok Eye. The temple has been observing this religious festival since its dedication in 1880 only interrupted by the two World Wars and a revolutionary war in China. 
“It is feared the temple, described as a one–of–a–kind example of Chinese sacred architecture, will not survive another rainy season.” “HISTORIC BOK KAI TEMPLE IN OLD MARYSVILLE” This is the first edition of the Historical Bok Kai temple booklet, published by the Marysville Chinese Community in February, 1967 (Chinese First Month of the Year of []
