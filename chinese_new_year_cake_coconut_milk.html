        <p>Method:. Preheat oven to 180C/350F. Beat the eggs and mix with sugar very well. Add coconut milk and glutinous flour, and combine until very smooth. 
COCONUT MILK. In addition to water, my mom likes to use coconut milk for the batter because the coconut milk makes the nian gao rich and soft. Mama Lin uses canned full-fat coconut milk. However, canned lite coconut milk should also work. Don’t use drinking coconut milk, as there isn’t enough fat in it. 
Unlike the typical New Year’s cake, her version is made with Coconut Milk and a delicious layer of red bean filling in the middle. Mrs. Leong’s recipe carries a long and notable history. Essentially, it remains true to its originator: an Admiral’s daughter born in China during the late 1800’s. 
Baked nian gao (烤年糕) is a classic Chinese new year rice cake dessert. It is extremely quick and easy and quickly makes a large batch, so it is a convenient recipe for sharing with others during the lunar new year!. The most important components in this coconut nian gao are glutinous rice flour, coconut milk, and coconut flakes. 
To add a coconut taste to non-coconut milk, I recommend adding coconut flakes, shredded coconut, or coconut flavoring to the batter to retain the cake’s coconut flavor. Optional for color: Although brown sugar slabs are enough to give the rice cake a brown color, you can add an optional coloring ingredient if you want to make the color even  
Nian Gao cake (年糕) translates literally to ” the year cake” and is made from glutinous rice flour, regular rice flour, or sometimes with other extra ingredients like brown sugar and coconut milk. 
The cake is made with 6 common ingredients: glutinous rice flour (sweet/sticky rice flour), coconut milk (or you can use cow’s milk), sugar, eggs, butter, and sweetened toasted coconut. You can easily find glutinous rice flour in non-Asian grocery store too these days. 
The lunar new year is around the corner. Like last year we will be making some special snacks to welcome the new year. Today, we will learn how to make Chinese new years cake, also known as nian gao 年糕. Nian gao is made with glutinous rice flour which gives the nian gao a sticky and chewy texture. 
Directions. Preheat oven to 350ºF (180ºC). Grease two 12-cup muffin tins with nonstick cooking spray. Set aside. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together flour, milk, sugar, eggs, melted butter, ginger, coconut extract (if using), and salt; beat for 2 to 3 minutes or until smooth and well combined. 
Chinese New Year cake or nian gao (pronounced “neen go”) is a beautiful, tasty steamed cake made from glutinous rice flour, coconut milk, brown sugar bricks, and oil. Different regions in China have various versions of this wonderful dessert, and all of them are delicious. 
Nian gao (Mandarin for “higher year”) is a traditional steamed Chinese cake most often eaten at Chinese New Year. It’s unassuming-looking but super delicious: sticky, chewy, and not too sweet. 
In a small saucepan, melt 250g cane sugar, 60g brown sugar in pieces in 1½ cup of cold water slowly over medium heat. Pro Tip #1 – To Speed Up the Process: break down the sugar pieces once the water starts to warm. 
Dissolve the sugar and salt in boiling water. Add the coconut milk and any flavorings you want, and mix until combined. Then add the rice flour and mix well into a paste. 
During the busy Chinese New Year’s celebration week, we have lots of different cakes (gao 糕). Yes, we can’t celebrate without all the traditional cakes, radish cake, taro cake (aka yum cake), sticky rice cake and water chestnut cake.

Method:. Use a saucepan to bring 1 cup of water to boil. Add brown sugar and cook until completely dissolved. Stir in coconut cream and oil. Drain syrup through a fine sieve to make the mixture smoother. 
The civilians survived but the Kingdom fell. Since this event took place around Chinese New Year, people started to call rice cake, “nian gao”, which translates to “(new) year steamed cake”. From then on, many people sliced rice cake into the shape of a brick to commemorate this noble official of Wu. 
Melt the Sugar: In a small pot, combine brown sugar and water. Heat over medium heat, stirring until the sugar fully dissolves. Allow the mixture to cool slightly. Mix the Batter: In a large mixing bowl, add glutinous rice flour. 
Nian Gao and Chinese New Year. Sometimes referred to as "Chinese New Year cake", this is a popular dessert for Lunar New Year celebrations in many Asian countries, bringing good luck for the coming year. Here are some of the ways Nian Gao relates to the Lunar New Year Celebration. The name itself is actually a pun using the Chinese character  
Sticky rice is considered good luck for Chinese New Year because it’s symbolic of family cohesiveness, and it’s Chinese characters sound like “getting higher with each year,” implying prosperity in business, better grades, and promotions. </p>
