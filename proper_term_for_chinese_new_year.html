        <p>Layue (simplified Chinese: 腊月; traditional Chinese: 臘月; pinyin: Làyuè) is a term often associated with Chinese New Year as it refers to the sacrifices held in honour of the gods in the twelfth lunisolar month, hence the cured meats of Chinese New Year are known as larou (simplified Chinese: 腊肉; traditional Chinese: 臘肉; pinyin  
Why does Chinese New Year fall on different dates? Rather than following the western Gregorian Calendar with 365-day years, the Chinese New Year follows a lunar calendar based the moon's 12 phases. 
There is nothing wrong or offensive with saying Chinese New Year. However, if a person is referring to the New Year Celebrations taking place in all Asian countries or Asian communities throughout the world as “Chinese New Year” then this isn’t correct either. “Chinese New Year” should not be a blanket term used for this celebration. 
In recent years, the topic of correct terminology of the Chinese New Year celebration, has unfortunately been creating controversy. Some claim that referring to the celebration as 'Chinese New Year' may be insensitive, as there are several other cultures celebrating the same festival by a different name on this date, and so it is not strictly

Celebrating the Chinese New Year. In Chinese-speaking countries, the Spring Festival (春节 chūn jié) is a general term used to refer to the festival season.This term is likely to replace the English phrase ‘Chinese New Year’ soon, given UNESCO’s recent decision to include chūn jié in its Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. 
Chinese New Year specifically refers to the festival in China. Lunar New Year is a broader term for similar celebrations across Asia. Both are based on lunar calendars, but the Chinese calendar dictates the timing of Chinese New Year. Each term has cultural significance, but Chinese New Year is the more commonly used name. 
Lunar New Year. The Lunar New Year is determined by cycles of the moon and therefore the dates are movable, each new year commencing on the new moon which occurred in the late January or February of the Western Calendar. It is not the “Chinese New Year” but the “Lunar New Year” as the date is celebrated by many others besides the  
This shift is partly driven by efforts from countries such as South Korea and Vietnam. Both nations have long-celebrated lunar new year traditions, but have increasingly pushed for the use of “Lunar New Year” to distance themselves from the Chinese-centric framing. While “Chinese New Year” remains the most common term, its growth rate  
The terms Lunar New Year and Chinese New Year are often used interchangeably. But it’s not the same. Although both celebrate the start of a new year according to the lunar calendar, they have different meanings, traditions, and cultural significance. 
But the bigger issue is that almost every year, the Chinese New Year coincides with the Korean New Year (Seollal), the Vietnamese New Year (Tết) and the Tibetan New Year (Losar). Not to mention that some form of ‘Chinese’ New Year is celebrated in lots of other countries around the world by the Chinese diaspora (an estimated 50 million  
Chinese New Year is the term for us westerners still, some people are trying to change it to Lunar New Year (even official Mainland Chinese websites/places are doing this) to be more inclusive (it's called Spring Festival and so on in other places), but it's hard to change old terms and such, so ya it's understandable because it's what we grew

To avoid the embarrassment caused by cultural difference, one need to know the basic Chinese New Year gift giving etiquette, which is of great help in selecting proper gifts for your Chinese friends or inviters, enhancing the feeling of the receivers, and improving the relationship.

In China, only Chinese celebrating the New Year, hence they call it Chinese New Year or Spring Festival. 春节。 In Vietnam, they call it Tet. In Korea, it is Seollal (설날)。 In Singapore and Malaysia, it is Chinese New Year or 华人新年。 I'm celebrating my own festival and I call it whatever I want. Enough of this lunar new year shit. 
Chinese culture, Chinese New Year, and Lunar New Year have the same meaning, although the former is still the preferred term. That is because Chinese New Year goes beyond the commonly-known animal zodiac system and incorporates other cultural and religious elements from ancient Chinese culture.For example, Chinese New Year marks not only the  
Saying ‘Lunar New Year’ may be more inclusive to other parts of Asia that celebrate the occasion, but is unnecessary when the context and the people addressed are clearly Chinese.
