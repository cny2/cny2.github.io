The Lunar New Year is based on the lunar calendar, which is calculated by the movement of the moon . New Year's Day is also called New Moon Day in the lunar calendar when people cannot see the moon on the Earth, because it is located in the position between the sun and the Earth. 
Lunar New Year is the beginning of a new year based on lunar calendars or, informally but more widely, lunisolar calendars.Typically, both types of calendar begin with a new moon but, whilst a lunar calendar year has a fixed number (usually twelve) lunar months, lunisolar calendars have a variable number of lunar months, resetting the count periodically to resynchronise with the solar year.
