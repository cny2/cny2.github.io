        <p>Based on the image, each animal on the Chinese zodiac represents a Fire-type starter since Generation 1. Charmander and Cyndaquil are somewhat looser interpretations of the zodiac animals they represent, because Charmander is considered to be a Fire Lizard Pokémon (but later on evolves into the dragon-like Charizard) and Cyndaquil is more of an echidna rather than a rat, but according to its  
The Chinese Zodiac theory is a great way to do this and gets more on the nose as Pokemon’s other Fire-type starters are put under the microscope. Pokemon's Real-World Inspiration 
Many avid fans of the Pokémon franchise will be aware of the divisive theory proposing that the fire-type starter Pokémon are each based on an animal of the Chinese Zodiac. The concept of the Chinese Zodiac classifies each year that goes by within a twelve-year cycle, and each year in the cycle is represented by a different animal: Rat, Bull  
Are all fire-type starters based on Chinese Zodiac? While there never seems to be much rhyme or reason to each region’s Pokemon Starters, fans did realize there is one that the Fire Starters go by – the Chinese Zodiac. Every animal that a Fire Starter in Pokemon is based on appears on the Chinese Zodiac, as seen here: Dragon – Charmander. 
And now about the fire starters. But specifically with the new gen 9 fire type starter: The fire starters are all related to the chinese zodiac theory in some way or another. With the most subtle connection so far been Fuecoco´s line (male crocodiles are called bulls). 
Since ancient times, the Zodiac has been a major component of Chinese astrology and folklore. Your place on the wheel is determined by your year of birth, and it is believed that each Sign has fated personality traits. Additionally, each Sign can be influenced by the Fire element, giving further insight into personality. 
A lot of the Fire-type starters aren't directly based on their respective Zodiac animal, but nevertheless clearly correspond to it. For example, Typhlosion is based on a wolverine or a honey badger, and its pre-evolved form Cyndaquil looks like an echidna-- none of which are mice or even rodents. 
1996 was both the year of the rat and the year that Pokémon graced our lives. Most born in 1996 have experience playing the games and most are still fans to this day. That being said, it would be wrong to not assume that these fans love the nostalgia and are therefore perfect for a 1st gen starter. 
RELATED: Pokemon Fans Have Bizarre Theory About Nurse Joy. Chinese Zodiac Alternatives. Whether or not the Chinese Zodiac theory will lead to one of Gen 9’s new Pokemon being guessed early is debatable, but it’s worth looking at. Generations one through eight can indeed have their Fire-type starters compared to the Chinese Zodiac. 
Pokemon just uses the same basic body shape, they could do a zebra for the horse and it would still line up. It's the same for cyndaquil, a pokemon based mainly off of an shrew or echidna, works for the rat. The pokemon looks close enough to a rat to be more than just a coincidence. 
All that being said, I still think the Fire Zodiac theory is credible. I just don't believe ALL Fire starters fall into the theme. If by say, Generation 24, we have a 50/50 split of Zodiac and non-Zodiac within the Fire starters, that's still a really good number. And if we don't get any more Zodiac animals, that's fine by me too. 
One of the most famous Pokemon Theories of all time is the Chinese Zodiac theory revolving around the fire starters. However, what if I told you that theory  
Not sure why ppl think GF will copy the zodiac 100% with Pokemonthe fire starters are loosely based on it, while the Water starters are loosely based on aquatic animals with weapons attached. If Fuecoco gain bull horns, y’all will say it don’t count lol 
#PokemonSwordShieldGalar's fire starter Scorbunny confirms that every fire starter is based on a member of the Chinese Zodiac Calendar, a theory that is year 
cant say. fuecoco could just lose legs. FINALLY a non bipedal fire starter(i hope) fuecoco has really short limbs. i dont even think it uses them. so maybe it'll just get rid of them like how humans evolved to get rid of tails. snake is a zodiac. so maybe fuecoco is a snake. plus fuecoco looks like chillis. and there is a pepper called snake chilli in spain. so that might happen. 
For some fans, the new Pokémon Fuecoco has raised eyebrows for potentially upsetting a longstanding and popular theory regarding the Fire-type starters of regions' past. For years, fans have noted that each of the Fire starters aligns with an animal from the Chinese Zodiac.

First there are more fox pokemon to that point, I dont know the english names but the dark type from the fith gen or evee could be also aeen as a fox. Second Cyndaquill is called the fire mouse Pokemon because its a word joke in japanese. ヒノアラシ Hinoarashi is basically a fire porcupine, what is often refered as a needle mouse in Japan. 
One really widespread theory is that fire starters follow the chinese zodiac. For the most part, this has held true accross generations if we accept the cyndaquil line as a substitute for the rats, especially since cyndaquil is inspired by several small, cute mammals that have some ressemblance to rodents (I suspect the zodiac thing really began in gen 3 when they realised they already had a  
The starters' base forms - one of which carries a worrying implication - and the release date window are among the news that it announced. In the Pokémon games, the Fire-type starter is traditionally modeled after a member of the Chinese Zodiac. So far, eight animals have been used; the Dragon, the Rat, the Rooster, the Monkey, the Pig, the  </p>
