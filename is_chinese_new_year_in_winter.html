        <h2><strong>is chinese new year in winter chinese new year celebration south florida</strong></h2>
        <p>Each month begins with a new moon, and the new year begins on the new moon closest to the halfway point between the winter solstice and the spring equinox. Usually, that puts the holiday between  
Lunar New Year, also known as Chinese New Year or Spring Festival, is a major festival celebrated at the beginning of the Chinese lunisolar calendar. Thought to have originated in ancient China around 3,500 years ago, it is one of the most important holidays in Chinese culture, marking the end of winter and the beginning of the new year. 
Why does Chinese New Year fall on different dates? Rather than following the western Gregorian Calendar with 365-day years, the Chinese New Year follows a lunar calendar based the moon's 12 phases  
Chinese New Year's Eve and the first 3 days of Chinese New Year; will be made up on subsequent working days if any of the 4 days fall on Saturday or Sunday. The day before Chinese New Year's Eve is also designated as holiday, but as a bridge holiday, and will be made up on an earlier or later Saturday. 
Over 1 billion people celebrate the holiday, which marks the transition from cold winter to a season of renewal and ushers in one of 12 Chinese zodiac signs. 
The journey from the winter solstice to the Lantern Festival unfolds a vibrant tapestry of traditions that reflect the Chinese people's deep sense of ritual and their aspirations for a prosperous New Year. Rooted in ancient customs, this festive period bridges the cold winter days with the promise of spring renewal. 
Because the Chinese calendar defines the lunar month containing the winter solstice as the 11th month, the Lunar New Year usually falls on the second new moon after the winter solstice. Just like New Year according to the Gregorian calendar (January 1), Lunar New Year celebrations start on the night before the first day of the new year. 
When is Chinese New Year? The date of the Chinese New Year is determined by the traditional Chinese calendar, a lunisolar calendar that blends solar, lunar, and other cycles. The holiday falls on the second new moon after the winter solstice on December 21. Each year the New Year in China falls on a different date than on the Gregorian calendar. 
Chinese New Year starts a new animal’s zodiac year. In China, each lunar cycle has 60 years and 12 years is regarded as a small cycle. Each of the 12 years is defined by an animal sign: Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Sheep, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Pig. 2025 is the Year of the Snake and 2026 is the Year of the Horse. 
For Chinese people, Lunar New Year is the Spring Festival, and it’s celebrated widely in Taiwan and across Southeast Asia in countries with large Chinese populations, such as Singapore and Malaysia. 
As Chinese New Year is celebrated by Chinese people of certain ethnic groups (primarily the Han majority ethnicity), there are other ethnicities that may celebrate the Spring Festival in its more pure form, without regarding it as a 'new year' celebration, and instead celebrate a separate new year, unique to their culture or calendar, along  
The second half of winter is synonymous with celebrations for Chinese New Year (also called Spring Festival or Chūn Jié) in the capital. With more than 3,000 years of history, the festival takes over the streets of Usera starting in the last week of January. 
Chinese New Year (also called Spring Festival or Lunar New Year) is the most popular holiday in China and Chinese communities around the world.. As one of the most important and distinctive traditional Chinese folk festivals, Chinese New Year carries rich cultural connotations and profound national emotions.

Chinese New Year is also a time to ward off evil spirits and bad luck. Many traditions and customs, such as setting off fireworks and hanging red decorations, are believed to bring good luck and prosperity while scaring away any negative energies. Another important aspect of Chinese New Year is the emphasis on family and togetherness. Families  
The Chinese New Year is an important time to 拜年 (bàinián, to pay a new year call), so it is common practice to visit relatives and exchange auspicious greetings and Chinese gifts, including the ever-popular lucky red envelopes filled with Chinese currency. Devoted Buddhist and Daoist practitioners also often visit local temples to welcome

Each flower carries its own specific auspicious meaning. Application: These flowers are used to decorate homes and offices during Chinese New Year. For  
China has seven legal holidays in a year, including New Year's Day, Chinese New Year (Spring Festival), Qingming Festival (Tomb-sweeping Day), May Day, Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Day and National Day. Chinese people enjoy 13 days off in total for these official holidays.
