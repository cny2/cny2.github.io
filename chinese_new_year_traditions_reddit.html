During Chinese New Year, people have a long list of things to do. From one week preceding the festival to the 15th day after, many Chinese New Year customs are widely observed for thousands of years. The family reunion dinner, eating dumplings, and setting off firework are the must-dos that you might know. What else interesting do the Chinese do?

Staying-up on New Year’s Eve is one of the most important Chinese New Year traditions. On this night, families gather together to welcome the arrival of the Lunar new year. During the staying-up, the family can make dumplings, have New Year’s Eve dinner , watch the Spring Festival Gala, have heart to heart talks, and spend a warm and happy  
Festivals like Chinese New Year are ways for people to come together and interact, but individuals are also celebrating them differently than from the past. Sociologist Terence Heng explains how  
They uphold their traditions every year so I've been experiencing new year traditions for 30-some odd years. You're a little late for some of the customs this year, but hopefully this serves as a reference going forward, too. Meals. There are three major meals for Chinese New Year. 
NewJeans Danielle apologises as she refers Lunar New Year as Chinese New Year r/kpop K-Pop (Korean popular music) is a musical genre consisting of pop, dance, electropop, hiphop, rock, R&amp;B, and electronic music originating in South Korea.

Chinese new year: it originated in China, most who hear about it are often hearing about Chinese traditions specifically associated with the holiday, and I also know Chinese people just want their culture to be more out there (and I don’t blame them considering how many Chinese things have been rebranded).

Woks of Life has a pretty good section on just Chinese New Year dishes. They're also meant to be auspicious (dumplings look like money ingots for example).
