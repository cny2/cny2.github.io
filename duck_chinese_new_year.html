The Lunar New Year, also known as Spring Festival, is arguably the most significant and joyous holiday in China. It’s a time for family reunions, honoring traditions, and looking forward to a prosperous new year. Central to these celebrations is the feast, where Peking Duck often assumes a place of honor on the dining table. Chinese new year  
Oh, the luck of the duck! Lunar New Year is soon upon us, starting February 10, 2024, and that means much of the world is gearing up for one thing: a mega feast. Yes, the event has its many  
The Lunar New Year, or Spring Festival, marks the transition from one animal to the next—2024 is the year of the Dragon, which began on February 10th, 2024, and ends on February 24th, 2024. January 29th, 2025 (Chinese New Year) will signal the start of the year of the Snake. 
Over 1 billion people celebrate the holiday, which marks the transition from cold winter to a season of renewal and ushers in one of 12 Chinese zodiac signs. 
Let's delve into the numbers, particularly the surge in “dragon babies”. In 2024, during the Year of the Dragon, China witnessed a 5.7% year-on-year increase in births, with South Korea seeing a 3% rise. These spikes are noteworthy, considering both nations are grappling with declining birth rates. 
The Chinese culture is known for its festive banquets, particularly for weddings and Chinese New Year's celebrations, and crispy Peking duck. January 23, 2012 marks the new year so out with the "year of the rabbit" and in with the firey dragon. The dragon is a symbol of power and wealth. 
What makes Peking Duck a lucky food for New Year's is not just its delicious taste, but also its symbolism. The duck represents fidelity and loyalty, and the color of the crispy skin is said to signify gold and wealth. This is why it is considered to bring good luck and prosperity to those who eat it during Chinese New Year celebrations.
