Shaolin Soccer - 2001 
As one of the most financially-lucrative Chinese New Year movies in China, “The Mermaid” is among the prime examples that you can still make a successful Stephen Chow movie even without his onscreen presence.

Loosely based on the Chinese novel Journey To The West, this two-part film stars Hong Kong actor Stephen Chow as the Monkey God who happens to be reincarnated as a bandit. Here’s the backstory: in his past life, he was supposed to protect his master, the Longevity Monk, but he ended up betraying him. 
Did you know that there’s a new Stephen Chow movie coming out this Friday? Chow, the Hong Kong super-star comedian turned blockbuster filmmaker behind hits like “Shaolin Soccer” and “Kung Fu Hustle,” wrote and produced “Journey to the West: The Demons Strike Back,” a sequel to the terrific “Journey to the West: Conquering the Demons,” which he co-wrote/co-directed in 2013. 
The New King of Comedy (Chinese: 新喜剧之王) is a 2019 Chinese comedy-drama film directed, written, and produced by Stephen Chow. [1] [2] It is a remake of Chow's own 1999 film King of Comedy, this time set in Mainland China with different characters.

Chow re-confirmed news of the project while promoting his 2019 movie The New King Of Comedy. However, he also said that Kung Fu Hustle 2 won't be a direct sequel. 
It's safe to say that I've seen quite a few Stephen Chow movies. Since I love his movies so much, I had to make a list, but I couldn't simple choose only 10 of his films to endorse, so I made a Top 20. I found this list hard to make without repeating myself and you can probably see why. Hope you enjoy and if there are any you would recommend that aren't on this list, please leave a comment. 
Andy Lau, Stephen Chow and Ng Man-tat join forces in God of Gamblers 2, a sharply comedic and action-packed film that plays as a sequal to both God of Gamblers and its parody All for the Winner.In  </p>
