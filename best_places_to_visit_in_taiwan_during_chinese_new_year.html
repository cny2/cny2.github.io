        <p>The Lunar New Year 2025 in Taiwan brings good fortune for many – one of the best places to experience the Lunar New Year in Taipei is Dihua Street in the Dadaocheng District. As well as the temples being awash with red lanterns and the constant smoke and bangs of fire-crackers being set off, Dihua Street plays host to a huge Lunar New Year  
In terms of restaurants in Taipei during Chinese New Year, most really do close for New Year’s Eve and the first 2-3 days of the New Year. If you look hard enough, though, you can still find a few open, including most fast food chains. 
Chinese New Year, also known as the Lunar New Year, is one of the most significant and vibrant celebrations in Taiwan. This festive season is marked by colorful parades, traditional performances, and a rich tapestry of cultural experiences. If you’re planning to visit Taiwan during this time, you’re in for a treat. 
Chinese New Year 2024 Holiday Dates. In 2025, Chinese New Year Day is on Wednesday, January 29. Everyone will be off work from Saturday January 25 to Sunday, February 2, which is nine days off. This year is a little interesting in that people will have several days off before the actual LNY date. 
Top Destinations to Experience Chinese New Year in Taiwan Taipei. Taipei, the capital city, is a hub of activity during the Chinese New Year. Visit the Longshan Temple to witness traditional rituals and enjoy the festive atmosphere at the Dihua Street Market, where you can shop for New Year goodies and souvenirs. 
2025 Lunar New Year in Taipei &amp; Taiwan. As well as the temples being awash with red lanterns and the constant smoke and bangs of fire-crackers being set off, one of the best places to visit for Lunar New Year is Dihua Street (迪化街) in southern Taipei. 
Must-See Events and Activities. During Chinese New Year, Taiwan hosts a variety of events and activities that showcase its rich cultural heritage. Here are some must-see experiences: Lantern Festival. The Lantern Festival marks the end of the New Year celebrations. 
My brother came to stay with us last Chinese New Year (or Lunar New Year, but most Taiwanese people I’ve met call it Chinese New Year). I was a little apprehensive about finding things to do during the trip as CNY presents a unique challenge for visitors in that the first few days everything tends to be closed, and then the last few days everything tends to be overwhelmingly busy. 
Visiting temples is a large custom during Lunar New Year. One of the biggest temples in Taipei City, Long Shan Temple was built in 1738 dedicated to Buddhist and Taoist gods. During the New Year, as the bells toil and the lantern-lighting ceremonies are being conducted, worshippers flock to the temple to pray for a good and prosperous year. 
Part of the reason is that January is kind of a lull between Christmas/New Year’s Eve celebrations in December, and the traditional Lunar New Year holiday, which often takes place in February. In 2025, Lunar New Year will come at the end of January (Jan. 29, national holidays from Jan 27 to Feb 2). 
Visiting Taiwan in February can be a little complicated because it is the month when the Lunar New Year holiday usually takes place. In 2025, Lunar New Year’s Day falls on January 29 and the holiday will last from January 25 to February 2. This will not be an ideal time to visit. For the best information about this, see my guide to planning a  
Honestly speaking, the Gregorian calendar New Year is more of a commercial season for domestic and international tourists, and, loosely speaking, the Lunar New Year, aka Chinese New Year, which is especially noted among the communities of ethnic Chinese, is an important time for family members to get together and to indulge themselves in good food. 
Gambling is as close to a religion as it gets in Hong Kong and Lunar New Year is an auspicious time to try your luck. Held on the third day (February 7, 2019) of the Spring Festival, the Chinese

Services are available for tourists of course, especially in big metropolis like Ho Chi Minh city, but could be suboptimal and patchy. If you like the whole special feelings leading up to Lunar New Year, stay there up until a few days before the New Year, but leave right before the first day of Tet (how they call New Year in Vietnam). 
Here, the holiday is very much a family-oriented time of the year, so the majority of Chinese New Year traditions tend to take place in the family home. While other communities around the world may celebrate with parades and the like, Taiwanese prefer to spend their time in the company of their family, particularly their grandparents and parents. 
The New Year holidays may be over, but it’s time to look forward to another — the Chinese New Year holidays! If you’re looking to escape the crowds inside and outside the house, along with nosy relatives and pesky kids asking for angbaos, we’ve created a list of the best places to escape from Singapore for much-needed getaways. 
Lunar New Year is a traditional holiday with Buddhist and Taoist roots. Visiting temples is a large custom during Lunar New Year. One of the biggest temples in Taipei City, Long Shan Temple was built in 1738 dedicated to Buddhist and Taoist gods. 
My husband and I have been travelling around Taiwan every year for Chinese New Year (by car), and despite what people are saying, we were never really stuck in traffic jams for too long, never encountered huge crowds or had problems with everything being closed.
