The Lunar New Year is this Friday, January 31, 2014. One of the traditional dishes eaten during the New Year for Chinese people is a New Year Cake. It’s a very simple steamed cake, made with glutinous rice flour for a mochi-like chewy texture and sweetened with brown sugar. 
Steamer VS instant pot method: As I remembered, my uncles and aunts made sweet nian gao for Chinese New Year. They used their hands to mix the glutinous rice flour and sugar into a paste-like texture and pour them into a container with banana leaves, then steaming them over the stove for 1-1.5 hours depending on how deep the pan you use.

Method:. Use a saucepan to bring 1 cup of water to boil. Add brown sugar and cook until completely dissolved. Stir in coconut cream and oil. Drain syrup through a fine sieve to make the mixture smoother. 
Lightly grease a 9-inch cake pan (or any 9-inch circular metal pan). My mom usually uses a round pan made of a very thin layer of stainless steel (see photo above, right). Those pans will cook the cake slightly faster because they’re made of a thinner layer of metal. I decided to use a regular cake pan for this because it holds more batter. 
Nian Gao Recipe Instructions. Prepare two 8-inch round baking pans by brushing the insides with vegetable oil.. Add 2 cups of water and the ginger to a medium-sized pot, bring it a boil, then let it simmer for 10 minutes over low to medium heat with the lid covered. 
Tikoy (say 'tee-koy') is a steamed Chinese rice cake with brown sugar and molasses. In the Philippines, an entire steamed cake is given as a gift for the Lunar New Year to symbolize prosperity and good luck. We cooked the Tikoy by pan-frying to soften it up. Once pan fried, each warm slice was crisp on the outside while sticky soft inside. The yellow coating of the eggs are close in color to
