        <p>Dumpling recipes for Chinese New Year Pork and Chive Dumplings (猪肉韭菜水饺) The pork and chive dumplings are one of the default choices for northern Chinese New Year. The filling is made with juicy pork, bursting with an intense savory flavor of garlic chives, and boiled until tender and hearty. Pork and Napa Cabbage Dumplings 
Make the wrappers . Stir together flour and salt in a large heatproof bowl. While stirring constantly with a fork or chopsticks, pour boiling water into flour mixture until shaggy pieces of dough  
Chinese dumplings, or jiaozi, are a quintessential part of Chinese cuisine, especially during celebrations like Lunar New Year. These crescent-shaped wrappers are typically filled with a mix of ground meat, vegetables and seasonings, then folded into neat parcels. 
Ingredients: 2 cups all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup water, salt, ½ cup minced boiled meat, 1/2 cup cabbage, 1/4 cup scallions, 2 cloves garlic,1 tbsp ginger, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 1 tbsp tablespoon sesame oil, 1 tsp rice vinegar, 1/2 tsp sugar, salt and pepper to taste, oil as needed. 
Making Dumplings is a wonderful part of the Chinese New Year Celebration, and if you and your family and friends want to try and make them at home we have three great recipes for you to try. All three can be made using the same basic dumpling wrapper recipe, or you can buy store-made wrappers: For the dumpling wrappers. Ingredients: 
Jiaozi and gyoza are both dumplings, but jiaozi is the Chinese version (jiaozi is the Mandarin word for dumpling) while gyoza is the term for the Japanese dumpling. Jiaozi is the original, going back roughly a thousand years, while gyoza was created after World War II when the Japanese brought the dumpling back to Japan after occupying Manchuria. 
The same philosophy applies to Chinese New Year’s Eve menu selections. Traditional New Year dishes are special—richer than standard fare. This is the time for whole fish and chicken, fried and crispy indulgences, and extra impressive, ornate appetizers. 
Yuanxiao are sweet glutinous rice balls that are typically filled with a sweet red bean paste, sesame paste, or even peanut butter.The Chinese believe that the round shape of the yuanxiao dumplings and the special bowls in which they are commonly served symbolize family togetherness. 
The five dumplings below, from recipe developers who’ve been creating dishes for New York Times Cooking for years, cover a range of tastes, but all started with loved ones gathered around a bowl  
To make the wontons, put the garlic, ginger, spring onion, coriander, celery, shiitake mushrooms and Chinese leaves in a large bowl. Add the pork mince and prawns (if using) to the bowl. 
From Polish pierogi and Italian ravioli to Japanese gyoza and Korean mandu, dumplings are universal comfort food.Even though there are as many variations as there are eaters, the classic Chinese dumpling is filled with a ground pork and garlic chive base to which cabbage, scallions, and black mushrooms can be added. 
Heat a little oil over high heat. Place in dumplings (Gently move the pan back and forth to make sure each dumpling is in touch with the oil). When the bottom part of the dumplings becomes golden brown, pour in cold water (enough to cover ⅓ of the dumplings). Cover with a lid (remain high heat). Uncover when the water evaporates completely. 
Wednesday, January 29th, will kick off the start of the Year of the Snake with celebrations of fireworks, family, and feasts all across the world. 
Apply appropriate treatments to fresh vegetable| the treatments of the vegetable including, stir-frying, blanch, salt marinating and oil mixing. If you use vegetables have a higher water content for example cabbage, chop them firstly and then marinate with salt for 10-15 minutes. 
This was the first dumpling recipe we ever published (originally posted on October 13, 2013, just 4 months after we started The Woks of Life). And while we’ve shared many other Chinese dumpling recipes since, this was the OG—the blueprint and the foundation of the recipes that came after, which is why we confidently gave it the moniker  
All of the dishes prepared for Chinese New Year have a symbolic meaning. We prepare particular dishes because the name of the food sounds like auspicious greetings or words people say to each other in the new year. In the case of sweet fried dumplings, those who eat the dumplings will have an outstanding new year. 
Ingredients. 1 cup finely chopped or ground pork ; ½ cup finely chopped cabbage ( preferably Napa) or bok choy ; 1/3 cup finely chopped celery ; ¼ cup finely chopped green onion 
Tasty and juicy filling wrapped with a pleasantly chewy skin, pork &amp; cabbage dumplings are the most popular dumpling variety in Northern China. 
Once the ladle has been treated, brush the inside with some oil, pouring any excess oil back into the bowl. Add 1 tablespoon of the egg mixture, and immediately turn the ladle in a circular motion to spread the egg mixture into a circle about 3 inches in diameter. 
What To Expect With This Dumpling Wrapper Recipe. This dumpling dough recipe includes 5 ways to color dumpling wrappers naturally using vegetables the way Mother Nature intended (without dyes or weird ingredients). They make delicious (beautiful) potstickers as well if you like crispy-bottomed dumplings as much as we do. </p>
