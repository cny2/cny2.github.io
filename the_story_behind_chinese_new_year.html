        <p>Chinese New Year (Spring Festival) is the oldest traditional festival in China, but a few people concern the origin and story behind the holiday. Many existing customs and activities of the festival actually can be traced back to a popular story of the Monster Nian, which helps to explain why and how the festival is celebrated.

The date of Chinese New Year changes each year because it's based on the lunar calendar. While the western Gregorian calendar is based on the Earth’s orbit around the sun, the date of Chinese New Year is determined according to the moon’s orbit around the Earth. Chinese New Year falls on the second new moon after the winter solstice. 
Legendary tales and mythological creatures are interwoven throughout the history of Chinese New Year. One of the most famous is the story of the Nian monster.

Like all traditional Chinese festivals, the origins of Chinese New Year are steeped in stories and myths.

Most of us are familiar with the Chinese Zodiac and how it differs from the Western Zodiac. The Chinese system is based on the lunar calendar and assigns an animal to each year within a 12-year cycle. It is said that people born each year receive some of that year’s animal’s reputed attributes. But where does this belief come from?
