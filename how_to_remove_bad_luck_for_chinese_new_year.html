From shouting auspicious phrases during lo hei and giving out angbaos and even numbers, it’s no surprise that Chinese New Year comes with lots of practices to follow. If you want to be extra careful this year, here are Chinese superstitions and taboos to keep in mind this CNY so you don’t start the year with bad luck. 
The Chinese word for “book” (shū) sounds exactly the same as the word for “lose” – so buying a book right after ringing in the New Year is considered an invitation for bad luck. 
The house is cleansed thoroughly to sweep out any bad luck and to make way for good luck in the new year. No cleaning on the first day of the year, however, as you can sweep away the luck of the new year.

How Chinese New Year is Celebrated. The Chinese Lunar New Year, also known as Spring Festival, is one of the most important holidays in Chinese culture.. During this time, Chinese people and communities worldwide celebrate with colourful traditions like lighting firecrackers to ward off bad vibes, exchanging red envelopes containing money for luck, cleaning their homes, gathering with family  
If you do, get rid of it as soon as possible to help drive away bad luck. If possible, try to cook fresh food every day.

In this case, the best solution is to seek cooperation with a powerful and lucky person in good faith. With the help of him/her, the magnetic field will be neutralized and you will become lucky and find it easier to succeed. This is called 'borrowing luck' in Chinese Feng Shui, which means to neutralize your bad luck with your friend's good luck.

On the 28th, 29th or 30th day of the new year, every household "posts the New Year's Red" (the New Year's Red is the collective name for the red festive elements pasted during the New Year, such as Spring Festival couplets, door gods, horizontal batches, New Year pictures, and the word "Fu").
