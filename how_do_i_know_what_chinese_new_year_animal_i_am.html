        <h2><strong>how do i know what chinese new year animal i am chinese new year pig drawing</strong></h2>
        <p>Each person's zodiac sign is decided by their birth year. Traditionally, Chinese people believe that each zodiac sign has fated personality traits and each different zodiac year has a lot to do with personal horoscopes. Below is our Chinese zodiac calculator. You can use it to find out about your Chinese zodiac sign and discover your horoscope  
The Chinese zodiac, known as Sheng Xiao or Shu Xiang, features 12 animal signs in this order: Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Sheep, Monkey, Rooster, Dog and Pig. 2025 is the Year of the Snake according to Chinese zodiac, starting from the 2025 Chinese New Year on Jan. 29th and lasting to 2026 Lunar New Year's Eve on Feb. 16. 2026 is the Year of the Horse. 
The most common-seen method depends on Chinese New Year, which is considered as the division of two animal years. When a lunar year comes to an end, the animal will shift to next one. Chinese people’s animal signs are marked by this method. The other method is calculated on solar calendar. In China, one year can be divided into 24 solar terms  
The Chinese New Year (Spring Festival) usually falls during 21 January and February 20, if your birthday is during this period in Gregorian date, you may belong to the zodiac sign of the last year. In the following table, the years’ starting and ending dates are clearly shown which help you determine your animal sign correctly. 
It is based on lunar months, that lasts for 29.5 days, and lunar year lasts for 12 or 13 months. Chinese New Year date is different every year. Sometimes it's 25 january, sometimes 20 february - this is far cry, so people sometimes don't know their real chinese zodiac sign. 
The Chinese astrological sign changes every lunar year, according to a cycle of 60 years. Thus, each of the 12 animals of the Chinese zodiac, Rat, Ox (Buffalo), Tiger, the Rabbit (Hare, Cat), Dragon, Snake, Horse, Sheep (Goat), Monkey, Dog and Pig (Boar) is associated with an element of Chinese cosmology, Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal and Water (12 x 5 = 60 years). 
The chinese calendar, being a lunisolar calendar, has no fixed date to mark the beginning of a year. e.g., The date of Chinese new year in 2025 is January 28. So a person born before the chinese new year has different animal sign from those born on or after the chinese new year even if they are are born in the same year in gregorian calendar. 
Not sure what your Chinese Zodiac sign is? Scroll down the list and find your birthdate to determine your sign. Feb 5, 1924 – Jan 23, 1925 Rat; Jan 24, 1925 – Feb 12, 1926 Ox 
The Chinese zodiac includes 12 animal signs, in order they are: Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog and Pig. The Lunar New Year, or Spring Festival, marks the transition from one animal to the next—2024 is the year of the Dragon, which began on February 10th, 2024, and ends on February 24th, 2024. 
The twelve animal signs in Chinese astrology are Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Sheep, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Pig. There is a reason why the animals are in the order that they are in. There are several legends of how the order came to be which tells a lot about the personality of the animal that rules over you.
