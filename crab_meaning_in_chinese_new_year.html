Many of the dishes are assigned symbolic meanings.  Tourists wait to board a train at Shanghai Hongqiao Railway Station to return home for Chinese Lunar New Year holiday in Shanghai on Jan 25  
Just like dumplings, Mandarin oranges also resemble gold ingots, in both shape and colour, carrying a meaning of wealth. As 'orange' and 'success' sound similar in Mandarin, and one of the ways of writing tangerine includes the Chinese character for 'luck', eating or displaying Mandarin oranges or tangerines around the home is believed to bring good luck and fortune. 
To add to the festivities, Phu and his family have a ritual of going to Harborview, a “must-visit,” for pineapple buns and dim sum, and to Abacá, where chef Francis Ang creates a Filipino Chinese New Year menu featuring Dungeness crab hot-and-sour soup and seared siopao filled with chestnuts.
