Ryukyu New Year is a traditional New Year in the Ryukyu Islands (the Okinawa Prefecture and the Amami Islands in Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan).Japan fully uses the Gregorian calendar after the Meiji Restoration, but the Ryukyu Islands still celebrate the New Year on the first day of the first month of the Chinese calendar. 
The Lunar New Year, also known as Chinese New Year is usually celebrated between late January and February, during the first new moon. This year, it will be on Wednesday, January 2025.

During the times of the Ryukyu Kingdom and all the way to the second World War, the lunar New Year, a.k.a. the Chinese New Year was a big deal in Okinawa, but the end of the war brought in the Americans and with them the Gregorian calendar, the traditions of the lunar calendar and with it the Lunar New Year has been diminishing ever since.

Happy Lunar New Year! How do you celebrate the new year in your culture? While Western countries spend only a couple of days, many Asian cultures throw a huge celebration and ceremonies to welcome the brand new year. For Japanese people, the new year is one of the most important event where families gather, cook special foods, and wish a blessing for health, prosperity and safety.In Okinawa  
Pre-Chinese New Year Preparations and Activities (Jan. 7–Feb. 12, 2025) Jan. 7, 2025: Laba Festival. Some Chinese start to celebrate and prepare for Chinese New Year as early as day 8 of the 12 th month of the lunar calendar. 
The second New Year is on the first day of the Lunar New Year, in line with the rest of the world. These celebrations are on a smaller scale but also incorporate elements of indigenous and Chinese culture. Lastly, the third and final New Year’s celebration takes place on the 16th day of the Lunar New Year, or Jūrukunichi in Okinawan.
