        <h2><strong>chinese new year cake with red bean chinese new year public holiday in malaysia</strong></h2>
        <p>Watch Daddy Lau teach us how to make nian gao with red bean, also known as nìhn gōu or Chinese New Year Cake. This video includes our family's nian gao recip 
Nian Gao Recipe with Red Bean - Baked Chinese New Year Rice Cake. Author: tsw. Servings: 16. Prep: 20 minutes mins. Cook: 1 hour hr 10 minutes mins. 4.6 from 85 votes  
Unlike the typical New Year’s cake, her version is made with Coconut Milk and a delicious layer of red bean filling in the middle. Mrs. Leong’s recipe carries a long and notable history. Essentially, it remains true to its originator: an Admiral’s daughter born in China during the late 1800’s. 
Baked nian gao is a surprisingly easy Chinese glutinous rice cake dessert that is chewy, lightly sweetened, and has a lightly crusty coconut top! The soft red bean paste filling adds an extra delicious layer. Baked nian gao (烤年糕) is a classic Chinese new year rice cake dessert. It is extremely quick and easy and quickly makes a large batch, 
Then, I found a children's book in the library, a Chinese version of The Gingerbread Man, which included a recipe for a baked Nian Gao with a red bean paste layer sandwiched inside the rice cake. Intrigued by this, I gave it a try and brought it to my young son’s class for a Lunar New Year celebration. 
For some reason, the flavor of red bean paired with sticky rice has become something irresistible for Asians. Nian Gao with azuki bean is especially popular during Chinese new year since red symbolizes good luck! Besides the common red bean Nian Gao, a simple brown sugar Nian Gao is also popular. 
Chinese new year cakes might have peanut oil, almond extract, red bean paste, stewed pork belly, lotus seeds, egg yolk, milk, coconut, sesame, etc.. It’s best not to assume that all nian gao is vegan or allergen free and ask before consuming store-bought or other homemade versions. 
Happy Chinese New Year! OK, so I am a bit late on this post, but since the Chinese New Year celebrations usually last several days, I’m technically still good. 2014 marks the year of the horse and I thought that I’d ring in the new year with some red bean sticky cake, which is pronounced nián gāo (年糕). 
Grease the bottom and the side of a 7 or 8-inch round pan. 7-inch pan will yield a bit taller cake. Pour half of the batter into the pan and then use a spoon to top with 3/4 of the red beans. 
Recipe Notes. To cook adzuki beans, soak 1 cup dried adzuki beans overnight. Then place drained beans in Instant Pot or pressure cooker; add enough water to cover by 1" for 5-7 minutes. 
Cut the dough into 6 even small pieces and roll them into small, flat circles. Put the red bean filling into the center of the dough skin, about 1 tablespoon of filling. 
Red Bean Cake is traditionally a popular dessert served during Chinese New Year celebration! It is slightly sweet and the red bean flavor is plentiful! In 
During the busy Chinese New Year’s celebration week, we have lots of different cakes (gao 糕). Yes, we can’t celebrate without all the traditional cakes, radish cake, taro cake (aka yum cake), sticky rice cake and water chestnut cake. 
Red Bean Cake (紅豆糕) actually refers to two different dishes. One of them is a summer sweet treat made of red beans (aka Azuki Beans) and coconut milk with jelly-like consistency; the other one is the traditional steamed red bean rice cake made during Chinese New Year and exchanged between families and relatives. In creating today’s dish  
Sticky rice is considered good luck for Chinese New Year because it’s symbolic of family cohesiveness, and it’s Chinese characters sound like “getting higher with each year,” implying prosperity in business, better grades, and promotions. 
Discard the soaking water. Place the beans and pour 2 cups of water into the inner pot of instant pot. Close the lid and turn the sealing valve to "sealing". 
Glutinous rice flour (Nuo Mi Fen/糯米粉). The most important ingredient of Nian Gao, it’s made of finely ground glutinous rice (aka sweet white rice). It’s characterised by its sticky, stretchy nature once cooked, thus the name. 
2. Sesame Seed Balls . Sesame seed balls, or jian dui, are a popular dessert in China and Taiwan. Sold both in streets and dim sum restaurants, these ubiquitous treats are beloved by everyone. 
The Coconut and Red Bean Chinese New Year Rice Cake is an exciting twist on tradition, with layers of coconut and red bean bringing a rich flavor profile to the chewy rice base. This unique rice cake offers a delightful texture and a sweet surprise in every bite, making it a crowd-pleaser during festive gatherings.
