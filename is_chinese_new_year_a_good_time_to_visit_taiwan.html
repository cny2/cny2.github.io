        <p>Lunar New Year, the biggest holiday of the year for locals, is not a good time to visit Taiwan. The 7 to 10-day holiday usually takes place from late-January to late-February. Many things in Taipei and other major cities close at this time, hotels fill up around the country, highways have traffic jams, train tickets are hard to get, and flights  
When is Chinese New Year in Taiwan? Since the Chinese lunar calendar is based on the cycles of the moon, the dates of Lunar New Year vary by year. Chinese New Year occurs on the new moon that appears anytime between January 21 and February 20. The 2025 date for Chinese New Year in Taiwan is Wednesday, January 29. 
The Lunar New Year comes in winter (late January to late February) but can make travel a little tough. The Lantern Festival, on the 15th day of the Lunar New Year, is an event to remember. See my guide to surviving Chinese New Year in Taipei and other things to know about Lunar New Year in Taiwan. 
Chinese New Year 2024 Holiday Dates. In 2025, Chinese New Year Day is on Wednesday, January 29. Everyone will be off work from Saturday January 25 to Sunday, February 2, which is nine days off. This year is a little interesting in that people will have several days off before the actual LNY date. 
Chinese New Year in Taiwan is a time of joy, celebration, and cultural immersion. From vibrant festivals to delicious foods, there’s something for everyone to enjoy. By embracing the festivities and respecting local traditions, you’ll create unforgettable memories and gain a deeper appreciation for Taiwan’s rich cultural heritage. 
The heart of the Chinese New Year celebrations in Taiwan can be found in the bustling streets of Taipei. The city comes alive with vibrant decorations, dragon and lion dances, and spectacular fireworks displays. Be sure to visit the Longshan Temple, where locals gather to pray for good fortune in the coming year. The temple is beautifully  
The Significance of Chinese New Year in Taiwan. Chinese New Year, also known as the Lunar New Year, is the most important festival in Taiwan. It marks the beginning of the lunar calendar and is celebrated with family reunions, traditional feasts, and various cultural activities. The festival is a time for renewal, reflection, and celebration. 
Taiwanese New Year serves as both a time for family reunions and a reaffirmation of cultural heritage. It highlights Taiwan’s rich blend of Han Chinese customs, indigenous influences, and modern adaptations. [6] Taiwanese New Year celebrations incorporate a mix of Han Chinese traditions and local Taiwanese practices. 
For Chinese people, Lunar New Year is the Spring Festival, and it’s celebrated widely in Taiwan and across Southeast Asia in countries with large Chinese populations, such as Singapore and Malaysia. 
In 2025, Lunar New Year’s Day falls on January 29 and the holiday will last from January 25 to February 2. This will not be an ideal time to visit. For the best information about this, see my guide to planning a trip to Taiwan during Chinese New Year and what will be open/closed in Taipei at this time. 
I’m planning a trip to Taiwan and wanted to know the incidence of the Chinese new year. Is it a good time to travel, or will most things are likely 
My husband and I have been travelling around Taiwan every year for Chinese New Year (by car), and despite what people are saying, we were never really stuck in traffic jams for too long, never encountered huge crowds or had problems with everything being closed. 
Chinese New Year, also known as the Lunar New Year, is one of the most significant and vibrant celebrations in Taiwan. This festive season is a time of family reunions, traditional rituals, and colorful festivities that attract travelers from around the world. Whether you’re a first-time visitor or a seasoned traveler, experiencing Chinese  
My brother came to stay with us last Chinese New Year (or Lunar New Year, but most Taiwanese people I’ve met call it Chinese New Year). I was a little apprehensive about finding things to do during the trip as CNY presents a unique challenge for visitors in that the first few days everything tends to be closed, and then the last few days everything tends to be overwhelmingly busy. 
1/21 除夕 is like Thanksgiving or Christmas Eve, pure family time. Other than emergency service you will only have 24/7 convenience store open (required by the franchise); you might find some high end hotels serving New Year’s Eve dinner as well. 1/22 marks the new year. 
Peak travel season in Taiwan typically occurs during the summer months (June to August) and around significant holidays such as Chinese New Year in February. During these times, popular tourist attractions can become crowded, and prices for hotels and flights may increase significantly. 
2025 Lunar New Year in Taipei &amp; Taiwan. As well as the temples being awash with red lanterns and the constant smoke and bangs of fire-crackers being set off, one of the best places to visit for Lunar New Year is Dihua Street (迪化街) in southern Taipei. 
Honestly speaking, the Gregorian calendar New Year is more of a commercial season for domestic and international tourists, and, loosely speaking, the Lunar New Year, aka Chinese New Year, which is especially noted among the communities of ethnic Chinese, is an important time for family members to get together and to indulge themselves in good food. 
I strongly recommend visiting Taiwan during the 15th lunar day of Chinese New Year (Yuan Xiao) to enjoy the festive events and celebrations in Pingsi. Yuan Xiao is the only time of the year when lighted sky lanterns are mass released into the evening sky. 
Chinese New Year in Taiwan is a time for family reunions, honoring ancestors, and celebrating new beginnings. The festivities typically last for 15 days, culminating in the Lantern Festival. During this period, the island comes alive with vibrant decorations, traditional music, and the tantalizing aroma of festive foods. </p>
