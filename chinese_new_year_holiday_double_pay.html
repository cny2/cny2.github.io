        <p>4. Work on a Rest Day: If the special day coincides with an employee’s rest day, they are entitled to an additional 50% of their basic wage for the first eight hours, computed as Basic wage ×  
The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) has set pay guidelines for 29 January or the celebration of the Lunar New Year. In Labor Advisory No. 01, the Labor Department reminded employers to properly compensate their employees during the Lunar New Year, a special non-working day. 
Regular Holidays are important days like New Year’s Day, Independence Day, and Christmas, while Special Holidays are less important days such as Ninoy Aquino Day or Chinese New Year. Recently, the Labor Department released the proper pay rules for workers who’ll be clocking in on January 29, 2025, which marks Chinese New Year. 
In Labor Advisory No. 1, series of 2025, DOLE Secretary Bienvenido E. Laguesma said Jan. 29, which is observed as Chinese New Year, has been declared a special non-working holiday under Presidential Proclamation 727 by President Marcos. 
The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) on Wednesday released the pay rules for the Chinese New Year holiday, reminding employers to properly compensate workers who will report for duty on January 29. DOLE, citing Labor Advisory No.1, said employees reporting for work on January 29 should be paid as follows: 
The Department of Labor and Employment reminded private employers of the proper pay rules for their workers who will report for work during Chinese New Year on January 29. Labor Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma said Jan. 29 has been declared a special non-working holiday under Presidential Proclamation 727 by President Marcos 
The Department of Labor and Employment has issued its first labor advisory this year to remind employers of the proper payment of wages for the additional special non-working holidays on February  
For work done during a regular holiday that also falls on the employee’s rest day, the employer shall pay the employee an additional 30 percent of the basic wage of 200 percent (basic wage x 200  
MANILA – The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) on Saturday reminded employers and employees that the “no work, no pay” policy will be implemented during the Chinese New Year holidays on Feb. 9 and 10, which have been both declared as special non-working days. In Labor Advisory 01,

MANILA -- Private sector employees who will report to work on Friday which was declared as special non-working holiday in the celebration of Chinese New Year, are entitled to receive additional 30 percent of their daily rate, on the first eight hours of work for that day. “For work done during 
THE Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) reminded employers and employees that the “no work, no pay” policy will be implemented during the Chinese New Year holidays on Feb. 9 and 10, which have been both declared as special non-working days. In Labor Advisory 01, series of 2024, the department advised employers to pay their  
Salaried workers can look forward to double pay for 11 days declared regular holidays next year. The regular holidays next year are: New Year’s Day (Jan. 1) Maundy Thursday (March 28) 
Nationwide holiday on January 29, 2025 for Chinese New Year. Payment guidelines for workers. Manila road closures. 
This means there are two regular holidays on the same date. According to the NWPB, if an employee goes to work on such a date, he or she must pay 300 percent of his daily wage rate. Triple pay will be in effect for the employee working on April 9 holiday. If you do not go to work, an employee is still paid 200 percent or double pay. 
The triple pay for working on national holidays can only be granted to the original national holiday days stipulated by law, such as one day for the New Year and three days for the Chinese New Year. Employees who work during the adjusted breaks will only be granted double pay for overtime. 
Feb. 9, 12, 13, and 14 are national holidays during the Lunar New Year period, and employees who are required to work on these days are entitled to double pay. Feb. 11 is technically treated as a regular holiday, though employees are also entitled to double pay, plus an additional day's leave if required to work. 
Then, if your boss insists that you work on a day that so happens to be a public holiday (it is within their rights to do this), make sure you get double the pay (triple pay for overtime) or a replacement day off (this doesn’t apply to non-replaceable public holidays—see the list in point 1). 
Overtime pay during Chinese New Year in Malaysia is calculated based on specific labor laws that provide enhanced rates for public holidays. This guide explains the legal requirements, overtime rates, and step-by-step formulas to help employers accurately compute overtime pay for employees working during the festive period. 
HOLIDAY PAY FOR CHINESE NEW YEAR – The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) has a reminder for employers. One of the countries that joins China in the celebration of Chinese New Year is the Philippines. </p>
