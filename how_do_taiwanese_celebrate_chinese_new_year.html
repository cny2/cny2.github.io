While other communities around the world may celebrate with parades and the like, Taiwanese prefer to spend their time in the company of their family, particularly their grandparents and parents. 
Before the New Year, a spring clean is a must.And while it helps to get rid of the junk collected over the year, there’s actually another more important reason for the annual pre-New Year clean up: the idea is that in removing old and unused objects, you’re making room for new luck in the coming year, and that by sweeping dust out the door and cleaning dirt off the windows, you are casting

When is Chinese New Year in Taiwan? Since the Chinese lunar calendar is based on the cycles of the moon, the dates of Lunar New Year vary by year.
