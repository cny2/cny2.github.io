Temple Fairs: A Hub of Tradition and Festivity. Temple fairs (miaohui) are among the most iconic and popular outings during Chinese New Year. These fairs date back over a thousand years to the Tang and Song dynasties, originally serving as gatherings around temples for religious worship. 
The 2025 Chinese New Year starts on January 29 to celebrate the Year of the Snake. The 15-day celebration marks the end of winter and the beginning of spring. In India, Mumbai’s iconic Kwan Kung temple is the hub for festivities at this time. Built in 1919, it is the only relic of the city’s Chinatown that once existed in the 1950s and 60s. 
In many Chinese cities, the local temple serves as a spiritual center. The third day of the new year, January 31, 2025, is traditionally a day for visiting temples. People visit to make offerings, seek blessings from deities, and consult fortune-tellers about the year ahead. This is also a time to pause and reflect spiritually as the new year

Temple fairs play an important role in the celebration of the Chinese New Year (Spring Festival) in Beijing. The best temple fairs in Beijing usually take place around the Chinese New Year and the Lantern Festival from the 1st day to the 15th day of the first month on Chinese Lunar Calendar. They offer visitors a chance to enjoy traditional

Like stated before, the roots of temple fairs were religious, but the importance of the performances and bargain hunting grew year by year. People could follow wonderful lion and dragon dances, play games and admire the talent of Chinese craftsmen.

Mumbai’s Chinese community welcomed the Year of the Snake with grand celebrations at Kwan Kung Temple, the city’s only Chinese temple in Mazgaon. The event featured prayers, cultural performances and traditional rituals, dragon dances, and festive decorations symbolising prosperity and good fortune. 
But, the Lama temple in downtown Beijing attracts an even bigger crowd as some 80,000 people visited it on the Chinese New Year's Day in 2018. Many may worry about the potential air pollution caused by incense burning, but Hongluo temple staff say the incense is environmentally friendly.
