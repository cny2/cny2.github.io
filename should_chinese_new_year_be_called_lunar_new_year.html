        <h2><strong>should chinese new year be called lunar new year what is special about chinese new year</strong></h2>
        <p>Simply put, Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year are not the same. Despite being related, there are a few noteworthy differences between the two. Read on to find out what they are. The Differences between Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year 1. "Chinese New Year" is specific while "Lunar New Year" is more general. 
Also known as Spring Festival or Lunar New Year, at least 385 million Chinese people are expected to leave the major cities to visit their families in rural parts of the country to mark the Year  
Chinese New Year is actually only one festival under the umbrella term of Lunar New Year, which is a festival that occurs on the first day of a new year in the lunisolar calendar, a calendar that  
Every year, the Lunar New Year marks the transition from one animal to another. The Year of the Dragon, which began on Feb. 10, 2024, ended Tuesday to begin the Year of the Snake. 
As the Lunar New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, approaches, with the Year of the Snake from January 29 to February 12, 2025, it’s not uncommon for people to mix up Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year. These two terms are often used interchangeably, but there are subtle differences between them. 
Each year in January or February, Chinese communities and countries influenced culturally by China all over the world celebrate the festival that has come to be called the Lunar New Year. 
The Chinese staff at the UN had reportedly suggested using "Lunar New Year" as a way to include Asian cultures outside of China in their celebrations. It's hard to conclude that UNESCO's inclusion of the Spring Festival in its intangible cultural heritage list means that Lunar New Year should be avoided. Quite the opposite. 
Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year are rich in cultural meaning and tradition. But it’s not the same. Lunar New Year encompasses celebrations of many cultures, while Chinese New Year focuses on specific Chinese traditions. When learning about these differences we can appreciate the diversity and beauty of each celebration. 
Most people in the UK recognise New Year's Eve as 31 December, however the Chinese and Lunar New Year varies year on year, yet usually falls around the end of January. 
You probably already know about Chinese New Year. Chinese New Year is a lunar new year celebration that’s similar to lunar calendars used by Tibetans, Hindus, certain Buddhist groups, and even one sect of Judaism. Lunar New Year is celebrated when the first new lunar cycle starts with a new moon. (A new moon is the absence of the moon.) 
Rather than following the western Gregorian Calendar with 365-day years, the Chinese New Year follows a lunar calendar based the moon's 12 phases. Each phase cycle spans approximately 29 days with  
The Lunar New Year, or Spring Festival — often referred to as Chinese New Year — signals the start of a new year and the coming of spring for the lunisolar calendar. With diverse traditions  
Calculating Your Lunar New Year Animal. The exact date of the Chinese Lunar New Year changes each year, so those born early in the Gregorian year should check the exact date of Chinese New Year in their birth year. For example, Jan. 30, 1976, was in the Year of the Rabbit, while Jan. 31, 1976, was the Year of the Dragon. 
With a history of more than 1,800 years, dumpling (饺子 Jiǎozi /jyaoww-dzrr/) is a classic lucky food for Lunar New Year, and a traditional dish eaten on Chinese New Year's Eve, widely popular in China, especially in North China. 
3. Start of the New Year. Lunar New Year: The Lunar New Year begins on the first new moon of the lunar calendar, which can fall between January 21 and February 20 on the Gregorian calendar. This

This year, the Chinese New Year 2023, will fall on Sunday, January 22nd, 2023 and end on February 5th, 2023. The Chinese New Year is celebrated for 16 days. Wait, can I still say Chinese New Year, or should I say Lunar New Year, Spring Festival, or something else? With the intention of being inclusive, what should this Holiday be called?

The time for handing out red envelopes is from the first to the fifteenth day of each Lunar New Year, and because it’s the lunar calendar, the calendar dates will vary from year to year. 
In terms of history, China created Chinese new year with their 12 zodiac signs and new year calendar and other SE countries adopted these principles throughout the decades of history these countries have with China. So it should be called Chinese new year. 
Also called Spring Festival in most of mainland China, Lunar New Year begins on the night of the first new moon of the lunisolar calendar, which is a bit shorter than the 365-day solar year. The 16-day festival season is celebrated with lots of traditional Chinese New Year foods that are prepared, served and eaten in symbolic ways. </p>
