        <p>The origin of the Chinese New Year Festival can be traced back to about 3,500 years ago. Chinese New Year has evolved over a long period of time and its customs have undergone a long development process. A Legend of the Origin of Chinese New Year. Like all traditional festivals in China, Chinese New Year is steeped with stories and myths. 
Since the mid-1990s people in China have been given seven consecutive days off work during the Chinese New Year. This week of relaxation has been designated Spring Festival, a term that is sometimes used to refer to the Chinese New Year in general. The origins of the Chinese New Year are steeped in legend. One legend is that thousands of years  
Chinese New Year has a history of about 3,500 years. Its exact beginning date is not recorded. Some people believe that Chinese New Year originated in the Shang Dynasty (1600–1046 BC), when people held sacrificial ceremonies in honor of gods and ancestors at the beginning or the end of each year. 
The traditions of Chinese New Year spread to these regions as a result of migration, trade, and cultural exchange over centuries. Vietnam, which was under Chinese rule for over a thousand years, celebrates Tết Nguyên Đán, which shares many customs with Chinese New Year such as ancestor worship, red envelopes, and lucky foods. 
Chinese New Year has a far-reaching history of over 3,800 years. The origin of the festival can be traced back to the worshiping activities in China’s ancient agrarian society. The date for the ceremony wasn’t fixed till the Han Dynasty (202 BC - 220 AD), when Emperor Wudi commanded to use the lunar calendar.

In this presentation, we will explore the history and customs of Chinese New Year and delve into the reasons why it is such a cherished and revered holiday in Chinese culture. Presentation: 1. Historical Origins: – Chinese New Year has a history dating back thousands of years, with its origins rooted in ancient Chinese mythology and folklore. 
Chinese New Year, also referred to as the Lunar New Year or the Spring Festival, is one of the most important traditional Chinese festivals and began around 3,500 years ago. This festivity is tied to the Chinese lunar calendar, and it originated as a time for feasting and to honor household and heavenly deities and ancestors. 
Chinese New Year is steeped in history, much of which intertwines with the story of Nian, a fearsome beast whose name coincidentally shares the same word for “year” in Chinese. As legend has it, Nian would terrorize villagers annually until a wise old man suggested using loud noises, firecrackers, and the color red to scare the monster away. 
Honoring the dead is a Chinese New Year's tradition that's kept to the word. Many Chinese people visit ancestors' graves on the day before the Chinese New Year's day, offer sacrifices to ancestors before the reunion dinner (to show that they are letting their ancestors "eat" first), and add an extra glass and place it at the dinner table on New Year's eve. 
Chinese New Year, alternatively referred to as the Spring Festival, is also commonly called the Lunar New Year – an inclusive name reflecting that many countries, not just China, recognize the

The Tang Dynasty period (618-907 AD) allows a change of paradigm in the Spring Festival celebration and the main function of the festival has also shifted.The festival was no longer perceived as a sacred ritual for the gods—which was the norm established for thousands of years—, and now the New Year was celebrated mainly as entertainment for both nobles and commoners. 
Chinese New Year is thought to be one of the oldest holidays in the world and has great significance for Chinese culture. This festival, based on the lunar calendar, also called the Lunar New Year, Lantern Festival, or Spring Festival, typically marks the beginning of spring and the end of the winter solstice, and it’s celebrated in many countries in Southeast Asia. 
The Role of Chinese New Year in Strengthening Community Bonds. Chinese New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, is more than just a time for fireworks and feasting; it serves as a powerful catalyst for strengthening community bonds, both within China and among the global Chinese diaspora. 
The legal holiday is seven days long, from the Lunar New Year's Eve to the sixth day of the first lunar month. Some companies and public institutions enjoy a longer holiday up to 10 days or more, because in common knowledge among Chinese people, the festival lasts longer, from the Lunar New Year's Eve to the 15th day of the first lunar month (Lantern Festival). 
Chinese New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, celebrates the Chinese New Year on their Lunisolar calendar, and celebrates the beginning of spring and the end of winter season. It is usually a week-long holiday in China, known for family gatherings and offering gratitude to the deities. 
With over 7,000 years of history, China boasts a rich cultural heritage. Perhaps one of the best ways to experience China’s legacy is Chinese New Year. Chinese New Year traditions date back over 4,000 years, and they’re some of the biggest celebrations in China. Family is central to Chinese New Year traditions.
