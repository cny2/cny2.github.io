        <p>So during the Chinese New Year Period, talks about death and funerals are basically a cultural taboo. And since Chinese New Year is basically the most auspicious and h Context for why there's no Hu Tao for 1.3 Genshin Impact | HoYoLAB 
The Hu Tao rap verses for Chinese, Korean, and Japanese were praised by fans. Genshin Impact is currently celebrating the Chinese New Year through a special event called the Lantern Rite Festival. The event offers players a plethora of rewards and entertaining in-game content such as more stories and mini-games to play solo or with friends. 
Hu Tao and Xiangling will both receive new skins as part of the Lantern Rite event. Hu Tao's can only be unlocked by paying for it, while Xiangling's can be unlocked by playing through the event. All Skin List For Characters Liyue-Themed Chronicled Wish Banner 
As we know, the new banners are only 2 weeks long this time around meaning, if there is a third banner, it would start on March 3rd. I bring this up because of the constant argument being presented that Hu Tao won't come in 1.3 because of Chinese New Year taboo. 
A new set of Genshin Impact 5.3 leaks have seemingly unveiled which two characters will receive fancy new skins next. Director Hu Tao,  in the game to celebrate the real-life Chinese New Year. 
HoYoLAB is the community forum for Genshin Impact and Honkai Impact 3rd, with official information about game events, perks, fan art, and other exciting content. 
The Chinese New Year of 2025 falls on January 29th (Wednesday), and will last to February 2nd. It is the Year of Snake. As an official public holiday, Chinese people can get eight days' off from work, from January 28th to February 4th. The Chinese New Year of 2026 falls on February 17th (Tuesday), and will last to February 21th. It is the Year  
Lunar New Year — which includes Chinese New Year, Seollal in Korea, Tet in Vietnam and more — begins on Jan. 29, kicking off more than two weeks of parties, customs and copious feasts. 
This festival will also see new outfits for Xiangling and Hu Tao, the former’s can be earned for free for a limited time via gameplay, the latter will be available for purchase at a discount  
Lunar New Year traditions vary across and within countries, but similar threads run throughout: family time, rituals for prosperity and to honor ancestors, and marathon feasts. 
Hu Tao[Note 2] (Chinese: 胡桃 Hú Táo) is a playable Pyro character in Genshin Impact. Hu Tao's antics and eccentricity belies her role as the 77th Director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor and her talent as a poet. Nevertheless, she treats the parlor's operations with utmost importance, and holds funeral ceremonies with the highest dignity and solemnity. Toggle Ascension MaterialsTotal Cost

Basically Hu Tao it's name sake and its origin is at least 1500 years before pecan, and Chinese more commonly refer Hu Tao as Walnut, while pecan is called "Long Mountain or American Mountain Walnut" So stop trying to argue it means Pecan, it really make you look dumb. 
In gameplay, Hu Tao possesses the Pyro element and wields a polearm as her primary weapon. Her skills require sacrificing health to increase damage output, requiring the player to manage her health and utilize abilities from other characters. [12] Hu Tao's Chinese voice actor, Tao Dian , described Hu Tao as a "creepy and cute" girl. After  
Sadly Hu Tao has extremely low chances to apear in Lantern Rite due to her association with death and how it's a bad omen to bring up death on Chinese New Year , hell ! They even went as far as to make a Keqing banner just to not release Hu Tao during the game's first Chinese New Year 
However, this year's Lantern Rite cutscene features the voices of Xinyan, Hu Tao, Shenhe, Cloud Retainer, as well as some others I believe. You'd either have to put the whole thing in CN for everyone (and thus have a CN Shenhe and Cloud Retainer no matter which language you play) or leave just the performance in CN (and thus have Hu Tao weirdly  
Players who want to get Hu Tao's new outfit should probably do so during Genshin Impact Version 5.3, as it is available at a discounted price for the duration of the update. Hu Tao is not the only  
Hu Tao's first banner had to be delayed because it was around the Chinese New Year, a time when you're not supposed to talk about the dead. Her rerun banner comes on Dias de Los Muertos, literally the day of the dead. </p>
