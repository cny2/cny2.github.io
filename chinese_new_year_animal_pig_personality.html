        <p>Pig is the 12th animal in the 12-year cycle of the Chinese zodiac, coming after the Dog and before the Rat (which begins the cycle anew). Recent years of the Pig include 2019, 2007, 1995, 1983, 1971, 1959, and 1947, with the next Pig year in 2031 (Year of the Metal Pig). They are associated with the earthly branch sign hai.
