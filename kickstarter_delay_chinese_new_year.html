        <h2><strong>kickstarter delay chinese new year chinese new year concert 2025 london</strong></h2>
        <p>Kingswood Games' efforts in fulfilling their Kickstarter and releasing the CCG into retail in Q1 2025 (see "Retail Preorder") have been thwarted by a production backlog forming in China factories as a result of the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday (see "New Lunar New Year "). Essentially, the company was racing against the oncoming holiday  
The annual Chinese New Year factories’ shutting down and resulting shipping delays present significant challenges for businesses, but proactive planning can make all the difference. In 2025, these disruptions are further amplified by the Red Sea crisis, which is increasing transit times and shipping costs.

Lunar New Year — which includes Chinese New Year, Seollal in Korea, Tet in Vietnam and more — begins on Jan. 29, kicking off more than two weeks of parties, customs and copious feasts.

The seventh day of the Lunar New Year (February 4, 2025) is said to be when the Chinese mother goddess, Nuwa, created humanity. Thus, it’s called renri/jan jat (the people’s birthday). 
It's usually not the reason for the delay, it just exacerbates delays caused by other things. If your timeline has the games being on boats to fulfillment centers before CNY, but something happens that delays production even slightly, you're suddenly looking at a month long delay even if it may have only been a delay of a few days at a different time of the year. 
January 28-February 4: Chinese New Year; Early to Mid-February: Gradual reopening of ports and businesses. February 12: The Lantern Festival marks the end of the new year, and a full return to work. Companies should be prepared for delays during this time. Let your Western Overseas representative know if you have any questions or concerns! 
She started off by telling me about how back in early 2020, things in China shut down (as you might remember) first due to Chinese New Year, and then for COVID lockdowns (some as long as a month and a half). However, there were only a few delays caused by this, but nothing too crazy. 
The Chinese factory rush to get goods out before the new year holiday, and the threat of US import tariffs, have seen global container port congestion hit a three-month high. Approximately 3.3m teu, or nearly 11% of the container shipping fleet, is held up at ports in Asia, Europe and North America, according to a Linerlytica report today. 
I understand some delays, but I also expect a certain level of professionalism which involves properly forecasting a correct delivery date. A common excuse that has been used was a delay due to Chinese New Year; as far as I know, CNY happens every year and is a big deal there. 
I will be celebrating my first Chinese New Year by making a moon cake. 
And my kickstarter got delayed until May/June, because of Chinese New Year. Ugh. 
Kickstarter projects often provide a behind-the-scenes look at how creative work gets made. For many projects, this involves updates from factories in China—and many of those factories were forced to shut down. The spread of the virus came at a time when factories throughout China were already taking a break for the Chinese New Year holiday. 
Each Chinese lunar year has a Chinese zodiac sign animal. The Chinese zodiac year's stsarting date is a little different from the Gregorian year. It starts from Chinese New Year. The Chinese zodiac years chart below is provided to help you find out the exact starting and ending dates of the Chinese zodiac years. (This is especially useful for  
As Chinese New Year comes to an end, the factories are making moves! It will be easier to give a fulfillment estimate as production comes to a close and the rewards are moved on to a ship. Logistics has continued to be tumultuous as the supply chains wrangle with the disruptions from these past two years. 
Their first announcement and major delay was an awful move since it was so out of left field. Things are being handled much better now. I personally have had products see delays and then get pushed up against Chinese New Year. It absolutely wrecked the schedule of some projects when I used to do PCB design. It happens a lot on the engineering  
Sometimes there are legitimate unexpected delays, like the coronavirus outbreak. 18Chesapeake is going to be delayed by at least a month I expect. I don’t know why so many Kickstarters run their schedule up to the Chinese New Year, because they always seem to miss the deadline and get delayed by it.

Other than the cultural and spiritual meaning the festival bestows to Chinese people, the 15-day long holiday (beginning with Chinese New Year’s Eve to the Chinese Lantern Festival) has a tremendous impact on the global supply chain, largely due to the uncertainty created by surging demand, decreasing manufacturing capacity, and the logistics  </p>
