        <p>Customs Frontline (Chinese: 海關戰線), previously known as War Customised, is a 2024 Hong Kong action film directed and co-written by Herman Yau and starring Jacky Cheung, Nicholas Tse, Karena Lam, Cya Liu, with Francis Ng making a special appearance. Tse also served as the film's action director alongside Alan Ng. 
A Chinese Ghost Story III: Swordsman Yin: Will of Iron: Jacky: The Perfect Match: Jacky Kim: 1992: True Love: Vincent Lam: The Days of Being Dumb: A Kei: With or Without You: Prince: Best of the Best: Li Man-kit: Deadly Dream Woman: Ji: Hot Hot and Pom Pom: Chien: The Wicked City: Ken Kai: 1993: Future Cops: Broom Man: Enigma of Love: Jackie  
Customs Frontline: Directed by Herman Yau. With Nicholas Tse, Michelle Wai, Francis Ng, Jacky Cheung. Hong Kong customs officers discover illegal weapons on a cargo ship and trace them back to an international conflict. 
Taking place in the legendary world of the Qing Dynasty, the movie stars Michelle Yeoh as a badass swordswoman tasked with recovering a mythic weapon called The Green Destiny. The film’s poetic aesthetics and cultural clarity make it a perfect choice for Chinese New Year celebrations. Just try not to replicate these moves at home. 
Last year, Hong Kong filmmaker Herman Yau directed at least two of the best action movies of the year. In the 1990s, Yau (“Ebola Syndrome,” “The Untold Story”) helmed sensational black comedies and/or true-crime thrillers about psychopathic skid row loners, some of which are now finding new audiences on American Blu-ray boutique labels. 
Jacky Cheung makes a big screen comeback after seven MIA years looking, well, kinda bonkers. Plot-wise, Hong Kong's port is being used as an illegal arms smuggling hub and the maritime authorities scramble to nail the elusive English-speaking foreign perpetrators and flush out the traitorous inside man within their ranks. 
Village chief Long Juanfeng has three daughters, all in different stages of romance. Eldest daughter, Xiao Dong (Samantha Ko), falls in love with scientist Ma Zhuang (Kenneth Ma). 
Cheung’s last lead role was eight years ago, as a disgraced pastor in the drama film Heaven In The Dark (2016). It earned him a Golden Horse Award nomination for Best Leading Actor. 
Discover these feel-good films perfect for Chinese New Year, featuring themes of family, love, resilience, and laughter. From nostalgic classics to modern gems, these movies will bring joy and warmth to your festive celebrations 
Styled &amp; Sutured: Fashion On Screen runs till Feb 23 at the Asian Film Archive’s Oldham Theatre, with a Chinese New Year break from Jan 27 to Feb 8. Prices for standard tickets are at $10, with  
Jacky Cheung Hok-Yau (Chinese: 張學友, born 10 July 1961) is a Hong Kong singer-songwriter and actor. The Chinese language media refers to him, Aaron Kwok Fu-Shing, Andy Lau Tak-Wah, and Leon Lai Ming as the Cantopop Four Kings, with more than 25 million records sold as of 2003. 
On the women’s side we have Brigitte Lin (who played the titular The Bride with White Hair alongside Leslie Cheung the same year), Maggie Cheung (who also featured in Flying Dagger and the classic Green Snake during the same year), and Joey Wong (who worked with everyone in 1993 – Maggie Cheung in Green Snake, Brigitte Lin in The East is  
All's Well, Ends Well was a Lunar New Year film, where a film's release was timed to coincide with the larger movie audience at that time of year. The movie is also one of Stephen Chow's trademark 'mo lei tau' films of little sense but lots of good-natured humor, and is still considered to be a cult classic by most Hong Kong audiences. 
Five years after his 2002 tour, Canto-pop god Jacky Cheung finally returned to the stage in 2007 for his long-awaited The Year of Jacky Cheung World Tour. In one year's time, he performed 105 concerts in 12 countries, bringing his perfect voice to the many fans around the world who have been touched by his music in the last 23 years. The singer held concerts in U.S.A, Canada, China, Macau  
The film was said to be caused by the over-budgeting of Wong Kar-wai's Ashes of Time.In order to cover up the cost of the yet unfinished film, the director decided to use many members of the cast to perform different roles and shoot a "quick-and-dirty" film for show during the Chinese New Year, a period for the Hong Kong film industry to harvest cash. 
Jacky Cheung (born 10 July 1961) is a Hong Kong singer-songwriter and actor. The Chinese language media refers to Aaron Kwok, Andy Lau, and Leon Lai as the Cantopop Four Heavenly Kings, with more than 60 million records sold as of 2000. 
Films released around the Lunar New Year often followed a certain convention, like a plotline about love and money, or the requisite traditional ‘Gong Hei Fatt Choi’ greeting by the cast at the end. But there is a slew of feel-good flicks, even without the festival element, that can be enjoyed with the family during get-togethers. 
2. 赌城风云 The Man from Macau (2014) This 2014 film owns the golden cast including Chow Yun Fat, Nicholas Tse and director Wong Jing, which is comparable to the classic film “God of Gamblers” 20 years ago. 
Whether they're acting courageous, cowering in fear, or just cracking jokes, Jacky Cheung and Stephen Chow are pitch perfect when the bullets start flying in Ko's impressive action sequences. When all is said and done, Curry and Pepper is, true to its name, not in the least a bland experience at the movies.
