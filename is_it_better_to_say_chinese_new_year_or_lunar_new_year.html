        <p>Simply put, Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year are not the same. Despite being related, there are a few noteworthy differences between the two. Read on to find out what they are. The Differences between Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year 1. "Chinese New Year" is specific while "Lunar New Year" is more general. 
Also known as Spring Festival or Lunar New Year, at least 385 million Chinese people are expected to leave the major cities to visit their families in rural parts of the country to mark the Year  
As the Lunar New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, approaches, with the Year of the Snake from January 29 to February 12, 2025, it’s not uncommon for people to mix up Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year. These two terms are often used interchangeably, but there are subtle differences between them. 
The Chinese calendar is also lunar-based (at least in part for the reckoning), which means the Chinese New Year is a Lunar New Year. However, the Chinese calendar is not the only lunar-based calendar; other cultures with similar lunar systems also have their own Lunar New Year celebrations, which may coincide with China’s New Year. 
Chinese New Year specifically refers to the festival in China. Lunar New Year is a broader term for similar celebrations across Asia. Both are based on lunar calendars, but the Chinese calendar dictates the timing of Chinese New Year. 
The Lunar New Year is traditionally a time for food, festivities, and family gatherings. It is celebrated in many countries, including China, Vietnam, Korea, Singapore, and Malaysia.

Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year are rich in cultural meaning and tradition. But it’s not the same. Lunar New Year encompasses celebrations of many cultures, while Chinese New Year focuses on specific Chinese traditions. When learning about these differences we can appreciate the diversity and beauty of each celebration. 
You probably already know about Chinese New Year. Chinese New Year is a lunar new year celebration that’s similar to lunar calendars used by Tibetans, Hindus, certain Buddhist groups, and even one sect of Judaism. Lunar New Year is celebrated when the first new lunar cycle starts with a new moon. (A new moon is the absence of the moon.) 
Among China’s traditional holidays and celebrations, none ranks higher in importance than the Lunar New Year (農曆新年). Also known as the Spring Festival (春節), or simply Chinese New

Several other Asian countries such as Korean, Thailand, Vietnam, etc don’t call it as Chinese New Year. They call it as LUNAR New Year. Japan used to celebrated it, but they stopped late in 1980’s – I am not sure why. I’d rather like to see everyone to called it LUNAR NEW YEAR as original. 
There will be Boston Chinatown Tours, a Chinese New Year Pop-Up Market, a Lunar New Year Night Market, a Lunar New Year Cultural Village, and so much more! Visit the Meet Boston website for a list of festivities. 4. Disneyland in Anaheim, CA. Of course, Disneyland celebrates the Lunar New Year with a slew of epic decor, food, and festivities  
Also known as the Spring Festival (春節), or simply Chinese New Year, it marks the beginning of the year according to the traditional lunar calendar. The Lunar New Year usually starts sometime  
Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year are two terms that are often used interchangeably to refer to the most important festival in many Asian cultures. However, they are not exactly the same thing. 
Lunar New Year Lion Dances in Taipei. There are several famous Chinese New Year / Lunar New Year dances in Taipei in 2025. Grand Hyatt Taipei Lion Dance / Dragon Dance. 29 January 2025. Celebrate the Taiwan Lunar New Year at the Taipei Grand Hyatt with a spectacular lion and dragon dance in the foyer between 11am and 1.30pm with a huge drum  
As January is coming to a close, it is also an exciting time as Lunar New Year is this Wednesday, Jan. 29. According to National Geographic, Lunar New Year is “the most important holiday in China and Chinese communities around the world.” It is a two-week celebration with various festivities and parties. 
Chinese New Year, or Lunar New Year, is the beginning of a brand new year in the lunar calendar, which falls on January 29 this year.The celebration of the new lunar year represents fresh beginnings, during which good luck is accumulated for the rest of the year through ritual practices as well as the exchange of verbal blessings and gifts exchanged between loved ones. 
I see the difference between CNY and LNY more like the difference between "Merry Christmas" and "Happy Holidays" respectively. Chinese New Year (春節 aka Spring Festival) is a subset of the Lunar New Year season, which also includes Seollal (Korean), Losar (Tibetan), Tet (Vietnamese), Tsagaan Sar (Mongolian), etc. 
In Japan, the Lunar New Year is celebrated as “Oshōgatsu.” The common way to wish someone a happy Lunar New Year in Japanese is: Formal/Informal: 明けましておめでとうございます (Akemashite omedetō gozaimasu) – Use this expression to offer New Year greetings, including during the Lunar New Year period. 5.
