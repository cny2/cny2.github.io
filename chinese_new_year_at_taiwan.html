Overall, the Taiwanese Lunar New Year is a blend of ancient customs and modern-day celebrations, offering a unique experience that highlights the country's rich cultural heritage. While similar in some ways to the Chinese New Year, Taiwan’s celebration has a distinct charm that reflects its national values and traditions. [17]

The Significance of Chinese New Year in Taiwan. Chinese New Year, also known as the Lunar New Year, is the most important festival in Taiwan. It marks the beginning of the lunar calendar and is celebrated with family reunions, traditional feasts, and various cultural activities. The festival is a time for renewal, reflection, and celebration. 
Before the New Year, a spring clean is a must.And while it helps to get rid of the junk collected over the year, there’s actually another more important reason for the annual pre-New Year clean up: the idea is that in removing old and unused objects, you’re making room for new luck in the coming year, and that by sweeping dust out the door and cleaning dirt off the windows, you are casting  
Here, the holiday is very much a family-oriented time of the year, so the majority of Chinese New Year traditions tend to take place in the family home. While other communities around the world may celebrate with parades and the like, Taiwanese prefer to spend their time in the company of their family, particularly their grandparents and parents. 
The Lunar New Year is Taiwan's most important and longest holiday.

Lunar New Year is more than money in red envelopes or meeting distant relatives during the annual family get together.

For nearly twenty years, I have been celebrating Lunar New Years in Taipei, running from temples to temples, placing spring signs after spring signs. Lunar New Year is my favorite holiday. During my four years in college in New Jersey, I missed celebrating with my family (couldn’t leave school in the middle of February). 
My brother came to stay with us last Chinese New Year (or Lunar New Year, but most Taiwanese people I’ve met call it Chinese New Year). I was a little apprehensive about finding things to do during the trip as CNY presents a unique challenge for visitors in that the first few days everything tends to be closed, and then the last few days everything tends to be overwhelmingly busy.
