        <h2><strong>danielle chinese new year reddit chinese new year 2025 dragon parade</strong></h2>
        <p>Calling the holiday "Chinese New Year" isn't inaccurate; rather, some non-Chinese East Asian people may find it insensitive perhaps. "Chinese New Year" originated in a historical period of ancient Chinese cultural domination in East Asia and was spread to other neighbouring nations/peoples. 
This was prompted by NewJeans Danielle's controversy and apology for saying 'Chinese New Year'. It just feels like a controversy that is waiting to happen every New Year, some idol will inevitably say Chinese New Year (CNY) instead of Lunar New Year (LNY) and knets will begin to dogpile them and release their sinophobia. 
It was a small mistake made by her because she might’ve been used to calling it Chinese New Year, and that is why she got forgiven so easily, but 설날 is an important holiday and her saying Chinese New Year makes the C-netz feel more validated because by blood, Danielle is still Korean. 
But to many international fans, this issue seemed to be no big deal since in the West, the festival is often referred to as “Chinese New Year,” or “Lunar New Year,” interchangeably. After Danielle posted her apology, the issue blew up even more, with many new posts being uploaded on Korean blogging forums to discuss the matter. 
On Jun 21st, an article titled “New Jeans Danielle Chinese New Year” was posted on various online communities such as FM Korea, Nate Pann, and theqoo. The article contained some messages that Danielle sent to her fans on ADOR’s exclusive communication app for NewJeans, Phoning, on Jan 19th. 
NewJeans' Danielle has apologized for referring to Lunar New Year as "Chinese New Year." On January 19, Danielle sent her fans a message on the fan 
NewJeans’ Danielle has apologized for referring to Lunar New Year as “Chinese New Year.” On January 19, Danielle sent her fans a message on the fan communication platform Phoning in which she asked, “what r u bunnies [NewJeans’ fans] doing for Chinese new year?” Danielle soon came under fire for 
NewJeans' Danielle apologized for calling the 'Lunar New Year' 'Chinese New Year.'. On January 21st, the NewJeans member posted an apology on the group's official Instagram account. Danielle wrote  
Kpop group NewJeans member Danielle was under fire because she used the term Chinese New Year to describe Lunar New Year.But even after she revealed her true personality by immediately apologizing, NewJeans Danielle Chinese New Year sincere apology gave her both praises and mixed reactions at the same time. 
On January 21st, NewJeans Danielle became a subject of criticism in South Korea after saying "Chinese New Year" instead of "Lunar New Year" while speaking to fans. The rookie idol took to Instagram to share a heartfelt apology while acknowledging her mistake. Hello, I'm Danielle of NewJeans. 
NewJeans Danielle apologises as she refers Lunar New Year as Chinese New Year r/kpop K-Pop (Korean popular music) is a musical genre consisting of pop, dance, electropop, hiphop, rock, R&amp;B, and electronic music originating in South Korea. 
Yeah but in fact is Danielle is Korean who work in Korea. Her post is like happy chinese New year when Korean don t celebrate the chinese New year but the lunar New year. It s confusing for non chinese and non Korean people but for them chinese celebrate the chinese New year and the Korean celebrate the lunar New year. 
Non-Chinese cultures have their own names for the day, so calling it Chinese New Year instead of Lunar New Year can be seen as dismissive of other cultures who celebrate that day especially if you are addressing an international fanbase. Even if she were to call it Korean New Year, the same reasoning would apply.

Not only does Danielle have little to no acting experience, but she is still a relatively new idol. In the eyes of the GP, she has yet to prove herself as more than a pretty face. There is a sort of stigma against idols in that they are perceived to not have actual performance chops, that any gigs they land is through their agency or from their  
A Korean or Japanese person celebrating Lunar/Chinese New Year isn't Chinese, lol (although China has much larger celebrations for CNY, which is where "Chinese" New Year comes from to begin with). Personally, I think it's just a situational term. Use whichever the people around you will agree with/understand. 
Be aware that you may find many things closed at that time. Museums, small restaurants and shops may be closed the week of the Chinese New Year holiday. You'll also have to deal with people going back to work when the holiday ends. You don't have to wait for months after Chinese New Year. Even 10 days afterward would probably be okay. 
The Chinese new year is from the American perspective, because The Chinese came to USA earlier that other Asian Group. My personal view is that you can say Chinese New Year to the other person as long as they are Chinese. Or you are a Chinese you want to wish western people a happy Chinese new year. 
Lunar New Year is an umbrella term for the 1st day of the year according to the lunar calendar, and Chinese New Year or Korean New Year or Vietnamese New Year (more (in)famously known as Tet) refers to the way it is celebrated in a particular culture. 
Hanni received hate from China because she wished everyone a Happy Lunar New year (which is the correct way, because it includes everyone who celebrates it) and they still hate her for not saying Chinese but since it's Hani noone came to her defense, so she is least popular in China.This incident also made Danielle more popular in China because  </p>
