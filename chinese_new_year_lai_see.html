        <p>The Tradition Of Lai See Red Packets In Chinese New Year. According to ancient Chinese folklore dating back to the Han Dynasty (206 B.C.–220 A.D.), it’s believed that an evil spirit would roam the streets on Lunar New Year’s Eve and attack anyone who was sleeping. 
With Lunar New Year comes one of China’s oldest customs: giving red envelopes to relatives, friends and employees. Known in Mandarin as ‘ hong bao ’ (meaning, ‘red envelopes’) and in Cantonese as ‘ lai see ’ (or ‘ lai si ’, meaning ‘being useful’), these slender, cash-filled packets represent a gesture of thanks, friendship and recognition – a momentary expression of  
With the festival fast approaching on January 29, 2025, if you want to get involved but are not sure of the etiquette, here’s everything you need to know.The most basic things to remember are to give and receive lai see with two hands and wish everyone the essential Lunar New Year greeting, “Gong hey fat choy,” roughly meaning “Best wishes for prosperity in the new year.” 
Sending digital red envelopes has become a new way to greet friends or relatives that cannot physically be reached during the Chinese New Year period. It has allowed more red envelopes to be exchanged than ever before. Other Occasions for Red Envelopes. Chinese New Year is a red envelope season. But red envelopes are not limited to Chinese New  
A single, crisp note. Fresh, new notes straight from the bank are the most popular, though the government encourages using “good-as-new notes for lai-see”. Coins are generally avoided. Weeks before Chinese New Year, banks will generally put up notices when it comes to withdrawing new, crisp notes. Make sure to visit in advance to avoid long  
Lai see is most commonly distributed during Lunar New Year but is also given out at weddings, birthdays and other special occasions. During Lunar New Year, lai see is handed out between the first and 15th day of the Chinese calendar, which in 2025 means you can start giving lai see from January 29. 
The Chinese New Year tradition of giving red packets (lai see in Cantonese) dates back centuries, and was meant to ward off evil spirits. Here is our comprehensive guide to giving and receiving

Usages and symbolism during Lunar New Year . Red packets are monetary gifts, most commonly used during the Lunar New Year as a symbol of good luck and prosperity, and to ward off evil spirits. Lai see are given by the elder and married members of the family to those younger, unmarried, or still in school. 
A red envelope, red packet, lai see (Chinese: 利是; Cantonese Yale: laih sih), hongbao or ang pau (traditional Chinese: 紅包; simplified Chinese: 红包; pinyin: hóngbāo; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: âng-pau) is a gift of money given during holidays or for special occasions such as weddings, graduations, and birthdays. [1] 
Giving lai see to people is a big part of Chinese New Year celebrations, so you don't want to miss out on giving (or receiving!) them in the following couple of weeks. But giving lai see is not like handing out candy to children on Halloween (unless you're one of those grumps who don't like giving treats to the kids without costumes). 
The Chinese New Year red envelope meaning is an important one and it’s very easy for non-Chinese gift-givers to give improperly. One of the most well-known symbols of the new year is the Chinese lai see in Cantonese (also known as hong bao in Mandarin), which are small red envelopes filled with lucky money. 
When to give lai see? There is a 15-day window during which it is acceptable to exchange lai see.

You can start your Chinese New Year greeting with gong xi fa cai in Mandarin, or “kung hei fat choi” in Cantonese (恭喜發財), and follow it up with “li shi dou lai” in Mandarin, or “lai see dau loi” in Cantonese (利是逗來). 
The spirit of Chinese New Year lai see giving is to wish someone a prosperous new year, show appreciation, show care. Ideally it shouldn’t be all about making bank, but rather as a way to start the New Year right.
