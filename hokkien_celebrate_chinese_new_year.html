        <p>Pai Ti Kong (拜天公) is celebrated on the ninth day of Chinese New Year. By Khadijah Amir — 30 Jan 2023, 01:28 PM #paitikong 
You might have the impression that Chinese New Year ends with Chap Goh Meh (Hokkien for 15th Night) for all subgroups, but the Hakka community is one that continues to celebrate longer than most as they observe Sky Mending Day (Tien Chon Ngid as the Hakkas call it) on the 20th day. 
Because of the central role it played in saving the community, sugarcane is an essential part of Hokkien New Year. A pair of whole sugarcane stalks – symbolising harmony and cooperation – are tied, one on each side, to the offering table or over the main doorway. Joss paper, known as kim chua in Hokkien, is tied to the top of the stalks. 
Most Chinese, including Ken’s family which is Toishan, celebrate the New Year on the first day of the lunar calendar. But Hokkien Chinese choose to celebrate on the ninth day. The large Hokkien community here in Penang makes sure their presence and their traditions are remembered with raucous celebrations including pleasingly cheesy dance shows, a [] 
Today is the 9th day of the Chinese New Year. It also marks the day of the Pai Ti Kong Festival! Fireworks are shot from house to house to celebrate this jolly festival. The people who celebrate the joyous occasion are mainly the Hokkeins. A long time ago, the Hokkeins from China immigrated to George Town, Penang. 
For the Hokkien people, worshipping the God of Heaven is also known as "celebrating the New Year". In Taoism, the 9 th day of the 1 st lunar month is believed to be the day when Yang is at its peak, and it is the birthday of the God of Heaven, or the Jade Emperor. 
The ninth day of the first lunar calendar holds particular significance for the Hokkien people, a subgroup of the Chinese community. Some traditionalists would even venture as far as to say that it is much more important than the Chinese New Year day itself because on that day, the entire Hokkien clan was spared from being massacred. 
The Mongols eventually gave up and returned to their base. On the ninth day of the Chinese calendar, the Hokkiens happily emerged from their hideout praising the celestial deities for saving them and believed that the Heavenly God had protected them. Thus, from then on, in all Hokkien celebrations, the sugarcane plant is given special prominence.

The Chinese New Year celebrations continue with thousands of Hokkien people celebrating Thnee Kong Seh (the Birthday of the Jade Emperor). Pai Thnee Kong translates simply as “worshipping the Jade Emperor.” The Hokkiens offer thanksgiving prayers on the 9th day of the Chinese New Year. 
The Hokkien New Year is celebrated on the ninth day of the first lunar month. It is a time for Hokkien people to pay homage to the Jade Emperor and to give thanks for their salvation from a massacre that occurred during the Ming Dynasty. 
What is Chinese New Year? Chinese New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, with more than 4000 years of history, marks the beginning of the Chinese year.

So, does Thailand celebrate the Lunar New Year? The simple answer is yes! In fact, as mentioned in the Hot Thai Kitchen Newsletter, Thailand is home to millions of people of Chinese descent; therefore, it comes as no surprise the country embraces this important festival with open arms.
