        <p>5. Wearing new clothes and wishing others good luck. On New Year’s Day, wearing new clothes symbolizes a fresh start. Wearing red is believed to attract luck and prosperity. 
Consider my daughter, Heidi, born in the Year of the Dog. She faced what is termed “offending the Grand Duke” or “Fan Tai Sui” (犯太岁) in Mandarin during the last Dog year. This belief holds that sharing your birth year with the current zodiac sign can invite bad luck. 
Each culture celebrating the Lunar New Year has traditions passed down from generation to generation that are thought to bring good luck. For the Lunar New Year 2025, I asked NPR readers and listeners to share the new and old traditions they practice to ensure a lucky year ahead. Here are some of their responses, edited for length and clarity. 
Ways to Cultivate Luck on Chinese New Year. 1 of 12. Lunar New Year (you'll sometimes hear it called Chinese New Year) is a huge celebration around the world. It's the perfect time to say goodbye  
Each culture celebrating the Lunar New Year has traditions passed down from generation to generation that are thought to bring good luck. For the Lunar New Year 2025, I asked NPR readers and  
There are many Chinese New Year traditions about dos and don'ts. Find out the top 18 things you should not do. Some are taboos on the first day of the Chinese New Year and some are superstitions for the whole New Year Festival season (from the 1st to 15th of the Lunar New Year). 1. Avoid taking medicine. 
1. Tangerine or Kumquat Tree — Wealth and Good Luck. Kumquat trees are a very popular plant displayed during the Chinese New Year holidays, especially in South China's Cantonese-speaking regions of Hong Kong, Macau, Guangdong, and Guangxi. Having a kumquat tree at home symbolizes a wish for both wealth and good luck. 
The third day of Chinese New Year – also known as ‘red mouth’ day, or cek hau (赤口) in Cantonese – is thought to be the most quarrelsome day between family and friends, so many people avoid social interactions and instead test their luck at casinos or visit temples. 
Lucky food is served during the 16-day festival season, especially on Chinese New Year dinner on New Year's Eve, which is believed to bring good luck for the coming year. The auspicious symbolism of these traditional Chinese New Year foods is based on their pronunciations or appearance. Not only do the dishes themselves matter, but also the  
5. 年花 (New Year Flowers) Symbolism: New Year flowers such as 桃花 (peach blossoms), 富贵竹 (lucky bamboo), and 桔子树 (tangerine trees) represent growth, prosperity, and good luck. Each flower carries its own specific auspicious meaning. Application: These flowers are used to decorate homes and offices during Chinese New Year. For  
Bidding farewell to the mythical Dragon, the world welcomes the Year of the Snake on January 29 — the first day of the Lunar New Year. For those who celebrate this ancient festival, starting the  
Chinese enclaves worldwide, including Binondo, come alive with dragon and lion dances that are believed to chase away evil spirits and bring blessings of wealth and luck for the new year. Led by the “Pearl of Wisdom” — the dragon weaves through crowds and the lion’s movements are accompanied by pounding drums and clashing cymbals. 
As the saying goes, every dog has its day. No one can always have good luck or suffer from bad luck all the time. There are ups and downs in life and you should seize the opportunities in the year of good luck. See the following for the year and age of best luck for each of the 12 zodiac signs. 
7. Grapes – A Year Full of Abundance. Grapes are another important fruit for New Year’s Eve. The tradition says that if you manage to eat 12 grapes at midnight, one for each month of the year, you’ll have good luck in the year ahead. This tradition dates back to the 1880s and is still going strong. 
Niangao (Chinese New Year Cake) Niangao, the sticky rice cake , emerges as a culinary metaphor-laden with auspicious meanings. Associated with growth, progress, and the anticipation of a higher income, its name echoes the desire for “increasing prosperity year after year.” 
The best Chinese New Year traditions to celebrate the Lunar New Year of the Snake in 2025. Try these good luck traditions of foods, colors and open windows. 
The Significance of Colors in Chinese New Year Symbols. Colors play a crucial role in Chinese New Year symbolism, with each hue carrying its own meaning and significance. Red: The Color of Good Fortune. Red is the most prominent color during Chinese New Year celebrations. It symbolizes good luck, happiness, and prosperity. 
Anyone can use a little extra dessert, luck, and prosperity in January, and Chinese cuisine is always a treat. Celebrate Lunar New Year with traditional and modern Chinese desserts, from almond  
1. Pinyin - Chinese Symbol for Luck. One of the most popular Chinese symbols of good luck is the pinyin character for fu, which represents good luck or good fortune. The ancient Chinese tradition of hanging a fu symbol on the front door is still practiced during the Chinese Spring Festival and Chinese New Year.
