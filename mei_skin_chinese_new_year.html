        <p>In Overwatch, the Lunar New Year cosmetics were cosmetics that could only be unlocked during the Lunar New Year event, either by logging in, completing limited time challenges, opening Lunar Loot boxes or purchasing them with Credits . In Overwatch 2, you can purchase any of the past event skins that were not part of weekly challenges from either the Hero Gallery with Credits and Coins (750  
The Lunar New Year event 2023 is here, and there are some enticing skins to add to your collection.  To nab yourself the newest Mei skin in Overwatch 2, you’ll have to collect your allowance  
Why didn’t Mei get a legendary skin for this event, you know, the Lunar New Year, the Chinese New year, the ONLY Chinese Hero? The one person who, understandably, would be the center focus of the event. But Mercy, the Swiss Heroine, the ethnical opposite of this entire event, got a legendary skin. Am I, like, missing something here 
The brand new Biohazard Ramattra and Hu Tou Mao Mei skins have just entered the shop! Today also marks the start of the Overwatch 2 2023 Lunar New Year even 
Lucky Mei receives a brand new cosmetic this Lunar New Year event, in the form of the Epic Hu Tou Mao skin.  Genji’s Legendary Baihu skin returns to Overwatch 2’s in-game store for 2023’s  
Besides the different modes, new skins can't be missing. As we have already seen in the season 2 trailer, Mei is one of the lucky ones to get a brand-new event skin. The Hu Tou Mao Mei Skin is now available in the event shop for 1000 OWC. Besides Mei, every Ramattra fan can also take pride in a new skin. 
The Lunar New Year event only has one new skin, a $10 Mei epic, which Overwatch 2 players aren't thrilled about. RELATED: Overwatch 2 Players Want A "Classic" Mode Inspired By The First Game What's more, this new skin is essentially a base recolour with a new hat, which isn't too surprising given that it's epic quality, but as it's the only new  
“The Year Of The Rooster” event starts next week, on Jan. 24, the exact start time is still unknown. Players have been speculating if there was going to be another event in early 2017, ever since Jeff Kaplan, Overwatch game director, teased that a new Mei legendary skin was in the works. 
It wouldn’t be fair to have a Lunar New Year list without Mei, the only character of Chinese descent in the Overwatch hero roster. This brightly-colored red and gold skin contains plenty of  
Mei has two new outfits for Year of the Rooster: Chang’e, the purple and jade skin, and Luna, where she’s donned in red and gold. Both skins, perfect for ringing in the Chinese New Year, cost  
The first step to unlocking Enshrouded‘s new Lunar New Year trader, Mei-Yin Chen, is to speak to Cade Hawthorn, the Carpenter. When you return to your base after initially logging on post-update  
They could release a skin honoring the year before (I know the season format changes from year to year but if it remained constant). So a skin commemorating the previous year's May Melee. Would be a good way to remember more history in a rapidly changing league, and to hype the tournaments themselves as distinct titles/events. 
Yeah, I mean an MMA skin doesn't really fit Mei, but you can tell who watches MMA based on who comments on the braids. It 100% fits an MMA skin, which is pretty shocking because it's crazy accurate to the sport. As an MMA fan, this is so so so cool. Maybe it'd be a bit fitting for another character, but I'm still a big fan of the skin. 
Overwatch's Year of the Rooster event is live, and along with it, 13 new Chinese New Year-themed skins and a pile of other cosmetics, including profile icons, sprays, victory poses, emotes, and  
Besides the different modes, new skins can't be missing. As we have already seen in the season 2 trailer, Mei is one of the lucky ones to get a brand-new event skin. The Hu Tou Mao Mei Skin is now available in the event shop for 1000 OWC. Besides Mei, every Ramattra fan can also take pride in a new skin. 
Mei is shining bright for the new year. One of the things that makes Overwatch stand out is how unique diverse its cast of characters is, so it’s always nice to see a cosmetic that pays homage to the culture of specific hero. That’s exactly what this skin does, as it outfits Mei in traditional Chinese garb. What Makes This Skin Legendary? 
The company unveiled a new legendary skin for Mei, a Chinese hero, in honor of the tournament that is scheduled from May 6–8, where she is dressed as an MMA fighter with a cornrow hairstyle. 
Like most of Overwatch’s Lunar New Year skins, Mei’s outfits for the Year of the Rooster are great. They caused a slight stir earlier today, though, when people who had previously believed

The MMA-inspired skin MM-Mei appeared on the Overwatch League store yesterday, sporting a fighter's robe, gloves, and championship belt. But it also gives Mei—a Chinese hero—cornrows, a  </p>
