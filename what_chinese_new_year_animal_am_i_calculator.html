        <p>Each person's zodiac sign is decided by their birth year. Traditionally, Chinese people believe that each zodiac sign has fated personality traits and each different zodiac year has a lot to do with personal horoscopes. Below is our Chinese zodiac calculator. You can use it to find out about your Chinese zodiac sign and discover your horoscope  
The Chinese zodiac, known as Sheng Xiao or Shu Xiang, features 12 animal signs in this order: Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Sheep, Monkey, Rooster, Dog and Pig. 2025 is the Year of the Snake according to Chinese zodiac, starting from the 2025 Chinese New Year on Jan. 29th and lasting to 2026 Lunar New Year's Eve on Feb. 16. 2026 is the Year of the Horse. 
The Chinese animal zodiac, or shengxiao (/shnng-sshyaoww/ ‘born resembling’), is a repeating cycle of 12 years, with each year being represented by an animal and its reputed attributes. Traditionally these zodiac animals were used to date the years. 
The chinese calendar, being a lunisolar calendar, has no fixed date to mark the beginning of a year. e.g., The date of Chinese new year in 2025 is January 28. So a person born before the chinese new year has different animal sign from those born on or after the chinese new year even if they are are born in the same year in gregorian calendar. 
The Chinese astrological sign changes every lunar year, according to a cycle of 60 years. Thus, each of the 12 animals of the Chinese zodiac, Rat, Ox (Buffalo), Tiger, the Rabbit (Hare, Cat), Dragon, Snake, Horse, Sheep (Goat), Monkey, Dog and Pig (Boar) is associated with an element of Chinese cosmology, Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal and Water (12 x 5 = 60 years). 
The most common-seen method depends on Chinese New Year, which is considered as the division of two animal years. When a lunar year comes to an end, the animal will shift to next one. Chinese people’s animal signs are marked by this method. The other method is calculated on solar calendar. In China, one year can be divided into 24 solar terms  
As per Chinese astrology, characteristics of a particular Chinese year has profound influence on the life of a person. The main astrological aspects of a chinese year include the Chinese zodiac - twelve animal signs which represents twelve different types of personality, the 5 major planets, the 4 fixed elements, a negative and a positive side  
The Chinese Zodiac is a 12-year cycle that assigns an animal sign to each year. It holds cultural significance in many aspects of life and influences traditions, festivals, and relationships.
