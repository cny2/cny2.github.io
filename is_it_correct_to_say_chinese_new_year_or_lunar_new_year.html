        <h2><strong>is it correct to say chinese new year or lunar new year suitable gifts for chinese new year</strong></h2>
        <p>Simply put, Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year are not the same. Despite being related, there are a few noteworthy differences between the two. Read on to find out what they are. The Differences between Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year 1. "Chinese New Year" is specific while "Lunar New Year" is more general. 
Some call this holiday "Lunar New Year", as it reflects the start of an annual cycle determined by the moon's orbit of Earth. Others call this celebration "Chinese New Year" based on an argument that the holiday originated in China under its lunisolar calendar. However, other Asian cultures also celebrate holidays at this time of year.

A longstanding debate over the usage of “Chinese New Year” versus “Lunar New Year” has reignited in recent weeks as people around the world celebrated the holiday, with brands and  
Every year, the Lunar New Year marks the transition from one animal to another. The Year of the Dragon, which began on Feb. 10, 2024, ended Tuesday to begin the Year of the Snake. 
As the Lunar New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, approaches, with the Year of the Snake from January 29 to February 12, 2025, it’s not uncommon for people to mix up Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year. These two terms are often used interchangeably, but there are subtle differences between them. 
Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year are rich in cultural meaning and tradition. But it’s not the same. Lunar New Year encompasses celebrations of many cultures, while Chinese New Year focuses on specific Chinese traditions. When learning about these differences we can appreciate the diversity and beauty of each celebration. 
Chinese New Year is actually only one festival under the umbrella term of Lunar New Year, which is a festival that occurs on the first day of a new year in the lunisolar calendar, a calendar that  
Lunar New Year, also known as Chinese New Year, marks the beginning of the lunar calendar and is celebrated by millions across Asia. Festivities span 15 days, featuring family reunions  
The 24 solar terms are based on the sun’s position, while the date of the Spring Festival follows the lunar cycle, based on the moon’s phases. Therefore, Lunar New Year is a suitable translation for 农历新年 (the Lunar New Year). Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year offer two different perspectives: 
Chinese New Year specifically refers to the festival in China. Lunar New Year is a broader term for similar celebrations across Asia. Both are based on lunar calendars, but the Chinese calendar dictates the timing of Chinese New Year. 
If you look up the Wikipedia page for Lunar New Year and compare it to the page for Chinese New Year, the page for Chinese New Year is at least five times longer, despite being the less general event. But generalizing Lunar New Year as Chinese New Year is more than just saying the wrong word and using the wrong name. 
In Japan, the Lunar New Year is celebrated as “Oshōgatsu.” The common way to wish someone a happy Lunar New Year in Japanese is: Formal/Informal: 明けましておめでとうございます (Akemashite omedetō gozaimasu) – Use this expression to offer New Year greetings, including during the Lunar New Year period. 5. Cantonese Chinese 
Think you are being culturally sensitive when you wish people “Happy Lunar New Year” instead of “Happy Chinese New Year”?Think again. The political correctness, or incorrectness, of saying ‘Happy Lunar New Year’ 
In their post “Chinese New Year, not Lunar New Year”, they wrote: “I encourage everyone to not replace the name CNY with ‘Lunar New Year’.” They then provided three reasons as to why CNY is the correct term. The first: CNY is not New Year’s Day in the Lunar Calendar. 
On this page, we've got the top ways to say "Happy Chinese New Year" in Chinese and Cantonese which you will use during the Chinese New Year period, which is from Chinese New Year's day (Jan. 29, 2025) up to the 15th day of the Chinese New Year (Feb 12, 2025). 
If you were to offer Chinese New Year greetings in English, "Best wishes for fast career advancement" probably wouldn't cross your mind. However, it's a very common greeting, aimed at young professionals, and students about to start their careers. Other Lunar New Year greetings along these lines include: 
My personal view is that you can say Chinese New Year to the other person as long as they are Chinese. Or you are a Chinese you want to wish western people a happy Chinese new year. Otherwise, just say lunar new year that will be ok with everybody except the CCP pinkers 
To say Happy Chinese New Year in Chinese, Qin Xie also explained: ‘Chinese New Year is also known as chun jie, or spring festival, so you can also wish your friends a happy new year that way.
