Let’s delve into the intriguing world of Hair Washing Superstitions and explore what to avoid during Chinese New Year to ensure a prosperous start to the lunar new year. As the dawn of Lunar New Year 2025 approaches on Jan. 29, the festive season sets the stage for a 15-day celebration steeped in tradition across China and various Asian

On the first day of Chinese New Year, you must not wash or cut your hair. In Cantonese, hair is pronounced as faat (髮), which is the same as the word for “getting rich” (發). If you wash your hair, it means that you’re washing your own fortune away for the coming 365 days. 
Leave your hair as it is on the first day of the New Year. The Chinese character for hair is the same first character in the word for prosper. This means washing or cutting it off is seen as

It is bad luck to cut anything during the 15 day Chinese New Year period, hence the Chinese tend to go for a haircut before the last day of the Lunar year so that they will not look unkempt, and also because a clean, well maintained appearance matters to usher in a prosperous new year. 
It’s to welcome the new year with a smile and let fortune and happiness continue on. The Spring Festival also involves somber ceremonies to wish for a good harvest. Strict rules and restrictions go without saying. To help you know what customs and rules to follow, here are the top 10 taboos to avoid during the Chinese New Year. 
7. New clothes for the new year Got your new clothes for CNY? The colour code for CNY? Bright is right. Back in the day, colours like black and white were a no-go during Chinese New Year, since they were traditionally associated with funerals. Instead, vibrant hues, especially red, were the preferred choice – it’s the colour of luck and
