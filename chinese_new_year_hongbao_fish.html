This year’s Chinese New Year falls on Feb 10. One of the things that everyone associates with Chinese New Year is hongbao (红包) — money-filled red packets given to family, friends, colleagues, and employees. Every year around this time, I always find myself checking in with others about how much to put in the envelopes. 
Giving “Hongbao” or ‘Ang Pow’ in Hokkien Chinese, or red envelopes filled with money, is a cherished tradition to celebrate Bangkok's Chinese New Year among Chinese families. These envelopes, often given by elders to children and younger family members, symbolize luck and prosperity over the coming year. 
If you’re invited to someone’s home for Chinese New Year, it is tradition to present hongbao to the children and gifts to the adults. If your hosts drink alcohol, they’ll appreciate a nice bottle of whatever it is they like most. Boxed loose leaf tea is always a nice gesture and the fruit basket is a ubiquitous symbol of Chinese New Year. </p>
