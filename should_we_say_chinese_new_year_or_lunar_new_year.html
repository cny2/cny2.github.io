        <h2><strong>should we say chinese new year or lunar new year kumquat chinese new year</strong></h2>
        <p>The Chinese staff at the UN had reportedly suggested using "Lunar New Year" as a way to include Asian cultures outside of China in their celebrations. It's hard to conclude that UNESCO's inclusion of the Spring Festival in its intangible cultural heritage list means that Lunar New Year should be avoided. Quite the opposite. 
So, Should We Call It "Chinese New Year" or "Lunar New Year"? In a casual conversation, there is no problem using the two terms interchangeably. Either way, whether you refer to it as the Chinese New Year or Lunar New Year, as long as no intentional offense is meant, it is safe to say that almost everyone will just be happy to share and

Every year, the Lunar New Year marks the transition from one animal to another. The Year of the Dragon, which began on Feb. 10, 2024, ended Tuesday to begin the Year of the Snake. 
“We can see that the ‘Lunar New Year,’ led by Koreans, is an ideological attack on Chinese culture by Western countries,” read one popular post on Weibo, China’s version of Twitter. 
In fact, back in 2023, New York State made Lunar New Year an official public school holiday. You don’t even need to travel far to experience the magic.

The Differences between Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year 1. “Chinese New Year” is specific while “Lunar New Year” is more general. The term “Chinese New Year” specifically refers to the new year celebrations in China. It is deeply rooted in Chinese culture, history, and traditions, dating back thousands of years. 
Some people argue that we should call the festival Lunar New Year rather than the Chinese New Year as it is more global and less culturally specific. Mine is a different discussion. 
As the Lunar New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, approaches, with the Year of the Snake from January 29 to February 12, 2025, it’s not uncommon for people to mix up Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year. These two terms are often used interchangeably, but there are subtle differences between them. 
If you look up the Wikipedia page for Lunar New Year and compare it to the page for Chinese New Year, the page for Chinese New Year is at least five times longer, despite being the less general event. But generalizing Lunar New Year as Chinese New Year is more than just saying the wrong word and using the wrong name. 
Ever wondered if we should be using the term ‘Chinese New Year’ or ‘Lunar New Year’? Well, a Xiaohongshu user has entered the discussion in hopes of answering that question once and for all.

The Chinese zodiac’s traditions and customs resonate through our actions even in contemporary settings. As the Year of the Snake approaches, we should not underestimate the influence of some of the common folklore beliefs. 
My personal view is that you can say Chinese New Year to the other person as long as they are Chinese. Or you are a Chinese you want to wish western people a happy Chinese new year. Otherwise, just say lunar new year that will be ok with everybody except the CCP pinkers 
As many are busy ordering dim sums to go or making that big family dinner reservation to celebrate the Tiger’s arrival, the translation community again finds itself in the debate of a familiar question: should we use Chinese New Year or Lunar New Year? And are there even any differences between the two? 
Pre-Chinese New Year Preparations and Activities (Jan. 7–Feb. 12, 2025) Jan. 7, 2025: Laba Festival. Some Chinese start to celebrate and prepare for Chinese New Year as early as day 8 of the 12 th month of the lunar calendar.
