Our three-phase research methods Results and findings Overall trend: "Lunar New Year" taking over "Chinese New Year" on Twitter. From 2021 to 2023, usage of both "Chinese New Year" and "Lunar New Year" on Twitter are much higher than previous years (2012-2020). 
“Stop appropriating my culture, it’s Chinese new year” was one of the more restrained responses on Twitter. The museum swiftly retreated by posting a traditional Chinese painting with the

Chinese New Year is thought to be one of the oldest holidays in the world and has great significance for Chinese culture.

Last Chinese New Year, a friend asked me whether it is okay for her to wear the cheongsam to celebrate the occasion or would it be a case of cultural appropriation.
