        <p>Occasionally, about every 24 years, Korean New Year will occur one day after Chinese New Year because of the new moon between Korea’s midnight (15:00UTC) and China’s midnight (16:00UTC). Okay, so nearly everyone in the world has adopted the Gregorian calendar and thus celebrate new year’s day on January 1st. 
The Chinese have three official New Year days (1st, 2nd, 3rd), but many places last for 7 days. In some places, the time is up to 15 days. Tet in Korea takes place for three days, the day before the new year, the 1st and the second day. The second difference is the color. The Chinese prefer red, the Vietnamese have yellow, and the Koreans

Lunar New Year, also known as Chinese New Year or Spring Festival, is a major festival celebrated at the beginning of the Chinese lunisolar calendar. Thought to have originated in ancient China around 3,500 years ago, it is one of the most important holidays in Chinese culture, marking the end of winter and the beginning of the new year. 
Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year are often used interchangeably, but they have distinct differences. Chinese New Year specifically refers to the celebration in China and among Chinese communities worldwide, while Lunar New Year is a broader term that includes various cultures and countries that follow the lunar calendar. 
In China, the Dragon Dances, a traditional performance art, are an integral part of many celebrations, including the Chinese New Year and the Lantern Festival. In contrast, Korea has its own unique traditions, such as the Seollal Lunar New Year celebration, which involves ancestral rituals and traditional games. 
Another big linguistic difference between Chinese and Korean is that Chinese is a tonal language, whereas Korean is not. In tonal languages, differences in voice tone (rising, falling, etc.) can change one word into another. As we have seen, there are many linguistic differences between Chinese and Korean. But there are also some similarities. 
The terms Lunar New Year and Chinese New Year are often used interchangeably. But it’s not the same. Although both celebrate the start of a new year according to the lunar calendar, they have different meanings, traditions, and cultural significance.

Both cultures celebrate the Lunar New Year and the Mid-Autumn Festival, though each with its own customs and traditions1.  However, there are distinct differences between Korean and Chinese  
While Lunar New Year encompasses a broader range of cultures and countries, Chinese New Year refers to the specific practices associated with Chinese New Year celebrations in particular. Despite their differences, both mark a time for renewal, family gatherings, and honoring ancestors, often with similar rituals and traditions. 
How⁤ is Seollal, the⁤ Korean Lunar New Year, different from Chinese New Year? Korean⁤ culture is rich and diverse, with many traditions and celebrations that stem from its historical context.⁢ One such celebration that raises the curiosity of many is whether ⁤Koreans celebrate the Lunar New Year.
