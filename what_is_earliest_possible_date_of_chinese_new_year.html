Chinese Calendar "Year" Established: In the Zhou Dynasty. The term Nian ('year') first appeared in the Zhou Dynasty (1046–256 BC). It had become a custom to offer sacrifices to ancestors or gods, and to worship nature in order to bless harvests at the turn of the year. 
The date of Chinese New Year falls on a different day each year.  Suppose the new moon rises at 8 pm, the entire day is the first day of the new month. 
During this time, people held sacrificial ceremonies in honor of gods at the beginning of the year. The date of the Chinese New Year was established during the Han Dynasty from 202 BC to 220 AD. Through the years, different ways of celebrating the New Year evolved. In 1949, the Chinese New Year was renamed the Spring Festival.

Chinese New Year doesn’t fall on the same day every year, because it follows the lunar calendar. According to this calendar, the new year begins on the new moon between January 21 st and February 20 th , so the exact date of the Spring Festival changes every year. 
The earliest possible date in the Gregorian calendar is 1582; the earliest possible date in the Julian calendar would be in 1 Ianuarius 1 (45 BCE). So there is a 17 century spread of what you mean by the "earliest date". 
"Earliest" thing I know of is Egyptian hieroglyphs which were established to talk about 3200 BC. (I am not 100% on this, this is just how I understand it) The only really ancient year I cling to personally is the first Olympic games in 776. </p>
