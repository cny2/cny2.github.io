The Lunar Events are recurring Events featured in Dead by Daylight, which usually happen in late January to mid-February, depending on the lunisolar calendar. The Lunar Events celebrate the Chinese New Year. There have currently been 7 Lunar Events: No Event in 2017 (Year of the Rooster) Chinese New Year 2017 (Mini-Event) Howling Grounds 2018 (First Lunar Event, Year of the Dog) Moonrise 2019

[Original Story] - The Dead By Daylight Lunar New Year event will return in 2022 and we shouldn't have to wait too long before the celebrations begin.

It somewhat fits the heart dotted shirt. 
The Year of the Ox has come to an end, and the Year of the Tiger has begun. In true Dead by Daylight fashion, we’re looking to celebrate in style with a new outfit that encapsulates the tiger’s deadly elegance.
