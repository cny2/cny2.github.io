On February 1, China and many Asian communities around the world will start celebrating the Lunar New Year. This holiday lasts for two weeks and has many old traditions. People march in parades and watch fireworks. They get new clothes to start off the new year fresh. And some people clean their homes to get rid of last year’s dust.
