        <p>Chinese New Year's Eve is the day before the Chinese New Year. Celebrating Chinese New Year's Eve has always been a family matter, it is the reunion day for every ethnic Chinese family. It has evolved over a long period of time. The origin of Chinese New Year's Eve can be traced back to 3500 years ago. 
The day before Chinese New Year's Eve is also designated as holiday, but as a bridge holiday, and will be made up on an earlier or later Saturday. Additional bridge holidays may apply, resulting in 9-day or 10-day weekends. [59] [60] [61] 4 (legally), 9–10 (including Saturdays and Sundays) [62] Thailand: Wan Trut Chin (Chinese New Year's Day)

The 3 most important days are Chinese New Year's Eve, Chinese New Year's Day and Lantern Festival. Chinese New Year Begins - Chinese New Year's Eve - Chuxi 除夕(Pinyin: chúxī) or Da Nian San Shi 大年三十 (Pinyin: dà nián sān shí) The day before Chinese New Year is the Lunar New Year’s Eve, also known as Chuxi.

Chinese New Year's Eve is the day before Chinese New Year, and its history can be traced back 3,500 years. Chinese New Year's Eve, also frequently referred to as Lunar New Year's Eve or the start of the Spring Festival, originated during the Shang Dynasty (1600 – 1046 BC) when sacrificial ceremonies in honor of gods and ancestors at the end of each year were held by the Chinese. 
A further custom is to eat a new year cake called niangao (Traditional Chinese: 年糕, Pinyin: nián gāo ,translated: year- cake) after dinner and send pieces of it as gifts to relatives and friends in the coming days of the new year, as it is believed that niangao indicates an increasingly prosperous year. 
Chinese New Year's Eve or Lunar New Year's Eve is the day before the Chinese New Year or is considered the end of the old lunar year. In 2025, Chinese New Year's Eve falls on January 28th . At the start of the Chinese New Year celebration period, Chinese New Year's Eve is a very important occasion for Chinese people, it is the reunion day for  
This year, Lunar New Year begins Jan. 29. Because the lunar calendar is based on the phases of the moon, the beginning of the year happens on a different day each year. 
The holiday is sometimes called the Lunar New Year because the dates of celebration follow the phases of the moon. Since the mid-1990s people in China have been given seven consecutive days off work during the Chinese New Year. 
Some Chinese start to celebrate and prepare for Chinese New Year as early as day 8 of the 12 th month of the lunar calendar. This is a festival called Laba ( 腊八 Làbā /laa-baa/ '12th lunar month' + '8'), in the traditional sense, which marks the beginning of the Spring Festival. 
Why does Chinese New Year fall on different dates? Rather than following the western Gregorian Calendar with 365-day years, the Chinese New Year follows a lunar calendar based the moon's 12 phases  
This year, Lunar New Year begins Jan. 29. Because the lunar calendar is based on the phases of the moon, the beginning of the year happens on a different day each year. 
The Chinese New Year’s Eve, as the name suggests, refers to the day on the calendar that comes right before the Chinese New Year. What Is Chinese New Year Eve? Celebrated the day before New Year’s, the New Year’s Eve celebrations are family-oriented celebrations that represent the day of reunion for Chinese families. It is 
The Chinese New Year dinner also referred to as the "Reunion Dinner", called tuan nien fan or nian ye fan in Chinese, is perhaps the most loved aspect of the Spring Festival. It takes place on Chinese New Year's Eve (January 28th in 2025). The Significance of the Reunion Dinner 
Chinese New Year, the grandest festival for Chinese people, is celebrated for more than half a month.According to the oldest traditions, people follow a day-by-day schedule of Chinese New Year festivities from the 23rd day of the 12th lunar month, with specific things to do on certain days. 
The Tang Dynasty period (618-907 AD) allows a change of paradigm in the Spring Festival celebration and the main function of the festival has also shifted.The festival was no longer perceived as a sacred ritual for the gods—which was the norm established for thousands of years—, and now the New Year was celebrated mainly as entertainment for both nobles and commoners. 
The Chinese New Year, also called Spring Festival, is the most important and widely celebrated festival of all in China. It is celebrated from the 1st day of the 1st lunar month to the 15th day of the 1st lunar month. 
As Chinese New Year is celebrated by Chinese people of certain ethnic groups (primarily the Han majority ethnicity), there are other ethnicities that may celebrate the Spring Festival in its more pure form, without regarding it as a 'new year' celebration, and instead celebrate a separate new year, unique to their culture or calendar, along  
On New Year's eve, the day before the festival kicks off, families prepare and partake in an important meal called the reunion dinner. For this special get-together, family members come from far and wide to welcome the new year and wish each other luck for the 12 months to come. 
The first day of the New Year is known as Yuan Dan (Chinese: 元旦; pinyin: yuándàn (First Morning of the year), New Year’s Day, First Day (or Duan Ri). During the 15 day period new year visits (Traditional Chinese: 拜年; pinyin: bài nián, translated: pay respect, worship, salute the year) will be made to family and friends. </p>
