        <p>At the Lunar new year, they turned two sui, and every subsequent new year after that, they were one more sui. [3] [4] Thus, by traditional reckoning, sui does not exactly mean "years old". In many Chinese societies around the world, a child's horoscope is calculated at birth and is considered relevant throughout their life. 
Yet, these booms are likely ephemeral, propelled by the Dragon’s association with strength and royalty – traits every parent might wish for their child. We might expect another surge in 2036, the next Dragon year. Beyond just birth rates, zodiac years significantly impact other behaviours, especially in financial contexts. 
The highlight of the celebration is Chinese New Year's Eve, when families gather for a reunion feast of symbolic foods, including dumplings shaped like ancient Chinese gold ingots that represent wealth, and fish, which in Chinese is a homonym of "abundance." The fish must be only partially eaten because the leftovers signify continuing prosperity. 
While in 2020, the Lunar Calendar’s 2 nd of June fell on the Gregorian Calendar’s 22 nd of July, a result of the dates of the two calendars usually do mot match, this is why the Chinese New Year falls on different dates each year. Therefore, Chinese people get to celebrate their birthday twice a year, one birthday in each calendar. 
Lunar New Year, also known as Chinese New Year or Spring Festival, is a major festival celebrated at the beginning of the Chinese lunisolar calendar. Thought to have originated in ancient China around 3,500 years ago, it is one of the most important holidays in Chinese culture, marking the end of winter and the beginning of the new year. 
Chinese New Year has its origins in the tale of the monster Nian, who would attack people and livestock on the eve of the new year. However, people learned the monster was afraid of bright lights, loud noises, and the colour red – which explains why those who celebrate share money and gifts via red envelopes. 
I’ve often found it fascinating how people traditionally count their age in Chinese culture, and how you can become one year older together on Lunar New Year’s Day. It’s so different from the culture I grew up in, where age gets counted on an individual basis — through birthdays, with the prerequisite individual celebrations (and  
China holds 1.4 billion people (18.4 percent of the world’s total population, but who’s counting?) and every year, nearly three billion people fan across the country, returning to their hometowns. 
What is the Lunar New Year? The Lunar New Year — known as the Spring Festival in China, Tet in Vietnam and Seollal in Korea — is a major festival celebrated in several Asian countries. In Taiwan, this year, people have been drawn to the White Snake Temple to pay their respects. 
Chinese New Year falls in the period from January 21 to February 20. In 2025, Chinese New Year will fall on Jan. 29. Click to see more about Chinese New Year date. 5. Why Do the Chinese Call Chinese New Year 'Spring Festival'?

The time for handing out red envelopes is from the first to the fifteenth day of each Lunar New Year, and because it’s the lunar calendar, the calendar dates will vary from year to year. 
The new year passed days ago, but the Chinese New Year, one of the biggest Chinese festivals, is yet to come.Chinese people often spend quite a lot of time, say 16 days from Chinese New Year’s Eve to the Lantern Festival celebrating this event since Chinese New Year is a major event that marks a new start. 
Chinese New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, is the most important traditional festival in China. Celebrated on the first day of the lunar calendar, it is a time for family reunions, feasting, and cultural traditions. 
He was known to appear every Chinese New Year's Eve during the night to touch a sleeping child's head three times, causing the child to fall deathly ill or even resulting in their death. Parents would stay up all night to watch over their children as the demon continued his bout of terror, until a worried couple decided to pray to their god to  
The Spring Festival, also known to most people as the Chinese New Year or Lunar New Year, is the most famous and the most important of all other festivals in Chinese culture. Chinese culture, as well as some other Asian cultures like Japanese and Korean, uses the Lunar Calendar rather than our standard Gregorian Calendar. 
Before the Chinese New Year, there are always many people waiting at banks to exchange cash for the new one. 3. You'd better put different denominations in differently designed red envelopes so that you can quickly and tactfully discern whether you're giving away 10 yuan or 100 yuan. 
Why Teach Chinese New Year: Exploring the Cultural Significance and Educational Benefits. Chinese New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, is one of the most important traditional Chinese holidays. It is a time for families to reunite, celebrate, and usher in a new year filled with good fortune and prosperity.

1. Do not Celebrate More than Once Every Year. The Chinese people have two birth dates, the western one and the lunar one, but you should choose only one date to celebrate. It is because they believed that the number of times you blow off the candles, the number of age increases. </p>
