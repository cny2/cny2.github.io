        <p>Nian Gao Recipe Instructions. Prepare two 8-inch round baking pans by brushing the insides with vegetable oil.. Add 2 cups of water and the ginger to a medium-sized pot, bring it a boil, then let it simmer for 10 minutes over low to medium heat with the lid covered. 
This Chinese new year cake is a sweet rice cake that is traditionally eaten during the lunar new year celebrations. Nian gao is directly translated to sticky cake, "nian" meaning sticky and "gao" meaning cake. Every family will buy this treat to celebrate the lunar new year, and it's also a very popular gift when visiting friends and family  
Glutinous rice flour (Nuo Mi Fen/糯米粉). The most important ingredient of Nian Gao, it’s made of finely ground glutinous rice (aka sweet white rice). It’s characterised by its sticky, stretchy nature once cooked, thus the name. This type of flour is actually gluten-free, despite its confusing name. Regular rice flour (Nian Mi Fen  
What You Need To Make Chinese New Year Rice Cake. To make Nian Gao, prepare 2 mixing bowls for the dry and wet batter and a whisk for mixing. I recommend using a non-stick pan for pan-frying the rice cake slices easily without sticking and for steaming the mixture (or any steaming appliance). 
In a small saucepan, melt 250g cane sugar, 60g brown sugar in pieces in 1½ cup of cold water slowly over medium heat. Pro Tip #1 – To Speed Up the Process: break down the sugar pieces once the water starts to warm. 
Every year, Mama Lin makes a nian gao (年糕, neen go in Cantonese) for Lunar New Year. The character “年” means “year” and “糕” roughly translates to “cake.” Put together, 年糕 means new year’s cake. In Chinese culture, you eat dishes that carry auspicious meanings during new year celebrations. 
The cake may puff up, but will settle once cooled. Carefully remove the pan from the steamer and let the cake cool for about 20 minutes. If desired, invert the pan onto a plate to remove the cake (or serve directly from the pan). Place the jujube at the center of the cake and sprinkle with sesame seeds. 
The most popular type of rice cake is made with glutinous rice flour and brown sugar. They are often steamed with red beans, dates, nuts or taro. This type of rice cake is considered traditional Chinese Nian Gao. The rice cake is steamed, sliced into pieces, dipped in beaten eggs then pan fried on both sides. 
Use a sieve to hover over the cake tin and pour the batter through. This will help to remove clumps. Hold the cake tin and gently tap the base against the counter to force any air bubbles to rise. 
Steamer VS instant pot method: As I remembered, my uncles and aunts made sweet nian gao for Chinese New Year. They used their hands to mix the glutinous rice flour and sugar into a paste-like texture and pour them into a container with banana leaves, then steaming them over the stove for 1-1.5 hours depending on how deep the pan you use. 
BAKED CHINESE STICKY RICE CAKE (BAKED MOCHI CAKE) My life is seriously changed forever after I tried this baked nian gao. All these years, I’ve been making steamed nian gao and it’s a must in our house to celebrate Chinese New Year. The Chinese wants to start the year (nian) high (gao) 😉 I decided I need to try the baked version.
