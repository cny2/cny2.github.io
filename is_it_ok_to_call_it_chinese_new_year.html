        <p>Many Chinese social media users in China saw red when bubble tea brand Chagee used the term "Lunar New Year". Read more at straitstimes.com. 
Some call this holiday "Lunar New Year", as it reflects the start of an annual cycle determined by the moon's orbit of Earth. Others call this celebration "Chinese New Year" based on an argument that the holiday originated in China under its lunisolar calendar. However, other Asian cultures also celebrate holidays at this time of year. 
In an online poll put up on Jan 24 on Weibo, 75 per cent of nearly 3,000 people surveyed as at Jan 27 said they will insist on referring to the festival as “Chinese New Year” and call out those who refer to it as “Lunar New Year”. 
This year, the Chinese New Year 2023, will fall on Sunday, January 22nd, 2023 and end on February 5th, 2023. The Chinese New Year is celebrated for 16 days. Wait, can I still say Chinese New Year, or should I say Lunar New Year, Spring Festival, or something else? With the intention of being inclusive, what should this Holiday be called? 
Rather than following the western Gregorian Calendar with 365-day years, the Chinese New Year follows a lunar calendar based the moon's 12 phases. Each phase cycle spans approximately 29 days with  
So, Should We Call It "Chinese New Year" or "Lunar New Year"? In a casual conversation, there is no problem using the two terms interchangeably. Either way, whether you refer to it as the Chinese New Year or Lunar New Year, as long as no intentional offense is meant, it is safe to say that almost everyone will just be happy to share and  
If you Google “Lunar New Year 2020,” the blurb which pops up to tell us the date specifically says, “Chinese New Year 2020; Saturday, Jan. 25.” If you look up the Wikipedia page for Lunar New Year and compare it to the page for Chinese New Year, the page for Chinese New Year is at least five times longer, despite being the less general  
Last week, K-pop singer Danielle Marsh asked her online fans what they were doing for Chinese New Year. A profuse apology followed two days later, in which she promised to “try to be more  
Chinese New Year (let’s call it that to begin with) is the celebration of the start of the traditional Chinese calendar. In China, observances start on the eve of the first day of the year and continue until the 15th day of the new year, which is also known as the Lantern Festival. 
As you’d expect, no one in China actually calls it “Chinese New Year”; they either call the festivities Spring Festival or Lunar New Year. It’s a bit like how no one in China calls it Chinese food. Some countries, like Singapore and the US, call it “Chinese New Year” because the largest segment of their Asian population is Chinese.

The time for handing out red envelopes is from the first to the fifteenth day of each Lunar New Year, and because it’s the lunar calendar, the calendar dates will vary from year to year. 
Let me pull out an interesting sentence for you: The Lunar New Year celebrations of the East Asian cultural sphere occur on the same date across the region, on the new moon, which occurs in late January or early February, and are based on the Chinese lunisolar calendar. 
This year, Chinese New Year begins on Wednesday, January 29. Those who celebrate will be entering the year of the snake. Just like with any holiday, traditions abound for Chinese New Year. Some of  
Lunar New Year is all encompassing, a way to acknowledge other new years, not just the Chinese one. There is also Japanese New Year, Korean New Year, Japanese New Year, Tibetan New Year, and Mongolian New Year, and they are all on the same day as Chinese New Year. Edit: Why the downvotes? I didn't pull this out of nowhere. This is from Wikipedia. 
Which is correct Lunar New Year or Chinese New Year? The festival that is frequently referred to as ‘Chinese New Year’ is not only celebrated in China. The term ‘Lunar New Year‘ is increasingly used to refer to festivals in other countries that take place at the same time and with many of the same traditions as in China. 
We can give it to one another while reminding each other that success comes from the Lord (Psalm 75:6). As for Chinese New Year goodies such as barbecued pork, pineapple tarts (pineapple is called “ong lai” which means “may good luck come to our homes”), melon seeds, fizzy drinks, to name a few, let us remember to give thanks, enjoy them and eat them in moderation (1 Corinthians 10:31). 
Here are six simple rules of Chinese New Year gift giving etiquette. These etiquette tips will help you give the right gift, in the right way, at the right time. 1. Select the New Year gifts in right colors. When giving a gift at Chinese New Year pay close attention to the color of the gift as well as the wrapping paper or bag in which it is  
The new year is a fresh start, like literally go buy a new shirt etc is the normal thing to do. You can wear whatever you want, although something more festive than denim would probably be better. Think 90s or 80s color palette haha. You just want to be as light and bright and festive as possible, if caring about it. 
To avoid the embarrassment caused by cultural difference, one need to know the basic Chinese New Year gift giving etiquette, which is of great help in selecting proper gifts for your Chinese friends or inviters, enhancing the feeling of the receivers, and improving the relationship. 
Taking naps, especially on the first day of the Chinese New Year, represents laziness. In Chinese culture, taking naps on the first day of the new year will affect your luck and career for the rest of the year. 9. Avoid breaking things in your home </p>
