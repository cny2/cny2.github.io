        <p>A tiger cub lashed out at at rabbit during a Chinese zoo’s New Year handover. The shocked staff shouted for the animals to stop and pulled them apart before the video cut off. 
On Jan. 21, in Linfen, North #China's Shanxi Province, Linfen #Zoo held the "#tiger-#rabbit handover" ceremony. Two staff held the rabbit and tiger cubs in a 
A rabbit in the Linfen Zoo in China’s Shanxi Province almost ran out of luck when a tiger cub attacked it during handover ceremony for the Lunar New Year.Zoo 
The event at the Linfen Zoo was to carry out the passing of baton from the Year of the Tiger (2022) to the Year of the Rabbit (2023) -- it made sense because the zoo had these animals in its exhibits. 
Chinese New Year 2023 - Baby tiger attack rabbit 
Different news media in China reported that the rabbit was ok as the zookeepers from Linfen Zoo were able to pull the tiger off the rabbit on time. On Sunday, the Year of the Tiger (2022) ended, and the Year of the Rabbit (2023) started in China, Japan and other East Asian countries. Vietnam celebrated the Year of the Cat. 
Chinese New Year (CNY) 2023 is all about the Year Of The Tiger making way for the Year Of The Rabbit. So if you run a zoo, what better way to mark the occasion than by involving the “live” animals in a promotional video? However, the idea almost turned bloody at a zoo in China when the tiger attacked the rabbit. 
Staff at Linfen Zoo in the Chinese province of Shanxi had planned a cute stunt on January 22 to celebrate the handover from the Year of the Tiger to the Year of the Rabbit. But the zoo's real-life tiger cub wasn't quite ready to let his reign end. 
What are some Chinese New Year traditions I can follow? Follow these Chinese New Year traditions and you practically ensure a wonderful new year! 1. Wear red, not white. White symbolizes death in the Asian culture so wearing predominantly white is a no-no. Also avoid giving white flowers—instead bring a colorful bouquet. 
Keepers at Linfen Zoo in Shanxi province brought together a real-life white rabbit and a tiger cub for the Chinese New Year handover on 22nd Janaury. And while the stunt – in front of specially-invited Chinese media – went well at first it did not take long for the tiger’s true nature to take over. 
The rabbit was saved by staffs who stoped the tiger cub. Source. Edit: this is not a tradition of China or any Asian country. It’s just the zoo’s new idea (We even have the year of dragon, obviously we can’t bring a dragon to a ceremony right?) So nobody thought this signed a good or bad luck. 
Bidding farewell to the mythical Dragon, the world welcomes the Year of the Snake on January 29 — the first day of the Lunar New Year. For those who celebrate this ancient festival, starting the  
The Year of the Snake.Here's your guide to the Lunar New Year. When does Chinese New Year start and end? Chinese New Year in 2025 starts on Wednesday, Jan. 29, and lasts until the Lantern Festival  
Tiger is the 3rd animal in the 12-year cycle of the animals of the Chinese zodiac, coming after the Ox and before the Rabbit. Recent years of the Tiger include 2022, 2010, 1998, 1986, 1974, 1962, and 1950, with the next Tiger year in 2034 (Year of the Wood Tiger). In Chinese astrology, the Year of the Tiger corresponds with the earthly branch  
In terms of the relationship with the people under other animal signs, the people born in the year of the Tiger can be harmonious with the people born in the year of the Pig, Dog, Horse, Rabbit, Sheep, Rooster and the Tiger itself. The honest and nice Pig can usually help the Tiger to avoid doing things rashly and make the Tiger feel safe. 
People born in the Year of the Rabbit will have a relatively stable fortune in love in 2025. Maybe their relationship was not smooth last year, but it will change greatly this year. They will welcome a year of strong peach blossoms, but as the "Xianchi" peach blossoms will secretly intervene, the single Rabbits may encounter a short-term marriage. 
What is Lunar New Year? Lunar New Year, also known as Chinese New Year or Spring Festival, marks the start of a new zodiac cycle based on the Chinese lunar calendar. Each year, the date shifts within the Gregorian calendar. Lunar New Year is celebrated around the world, particularly in Asian countries like China, shown here (Beijing). 
What's more, the Chinese New Year also features the fun of the Chinese Zodiac, with signs including, in order, Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog and Pig
