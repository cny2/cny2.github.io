Love, Bonito is every girl’s favourite — and we especially love that their outlets will stay open during the Chinese New Year. Don’t forget to check out their exclusive Lunar New Year collection, which features adorable mother-daughter dresses, tops, denims, and even button-up shirts for father-son duos.

Some smaller shops may be closed or holiday hours, and Changi Airport may be a bit crowded immediately before / after.otherwise, not much different. Just join in the fun with the celebrations. The top floor (roof) of Mustapha Centre in Little India has one of the best Indian restaurants outside of India but order off the menu, and not the  
I'm pretty sure they are all open during CNY, it is just that they are being sold out. All tourist site should be open. The shopping mall will face lots of shop closing down. Hawker and food stall close too but non chinese food stall are normally open with price hike. </p>
