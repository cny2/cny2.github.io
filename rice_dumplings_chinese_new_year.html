Make the wrappers . Stir together flour and salt in a large heatproof bowl. While stirring constantly with a fork or chopsticks, pour boiling water into flour mixture until shaggy pieces of dough  
Jiaozi and gyoza are both dumplings, but jiaozi is the Chinese version (jiaozi is the Mandarin word for dumpling) while gyoza is the term for the Japanese dumpling.

The small dumplings made from glutenous rice flour are served hot, in a bowl, swimming inside a ginger sugar syrup with osmanthus flowers. The round rice balls are usually white in color and are meant to look like little moons, representing the Lunar New Year (via BBC). 
With a history of more than 1,800 years, dumpling (饺子 Jiǎozi /jyaoww-dzrr/) is a classic lucky food for Lunar New Year, and a traditional dish eaten on Chinese New Year's Eve, widely popular in China, especially in North China. 
The word nian gao sounds like “higher year,” representing a better year to come. “People eat rice cake because in Chinese, the cake carries the meaning of height, so if you eat cake, it means that in the new year, you will have good luck,” Xiu said.

When referring to traditional Chinese New Year food, three dishes are top of the menu. They are: Dumplings, Glutinous Rice Balls and Whole Fish. However, as China is so large, there are other special Chinese New Year food traditions popular in different regions. 
Zongzi (粽子, Chinese sticky rice dumpling) is a traditional food for celebrating Duanwu festival (端午节, aka Dragon boat festival) which is on the fifth day of the fifth month of the Chinese lunar calendar (The exact date varies on a regular calendar each year).
