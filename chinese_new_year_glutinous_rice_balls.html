        <p>Top 30 Recipes for Chinese New Year; What is Tang Yuan. Tang Yuan/汤圆, also known as Yuan Xiao/元宵 or Chinese glutinous rice balls, is a round, stuffed Chinese dessert made of glutinous rice flour and a sweet, semi-runny filling. It’s always served warm in a plain or sweetened liquid. 
Roll the filling into small marble-sized balls, about 4 to 5 grams each. Then take each dough ball and flatten into a circle about 2 inches in diameter. Add the filling to the center, and close the dough over the filling. Roll the ball around in your hands until it’s smooth and round. Repeat until all the sesame balls are made. 
To Make the Skin: In a medium heatproof bowl, whisk glutinous rice flour and regular rice flour (or tapioca flour) to combine. Add the water, starting with 9 tablespoons (133g) and adding an additional 1 tablespoon (15g) if necessary, to make a soft but non-sticky dough. Divide the dough in half. 
If mooncakes are eaten during the Mid-Autumn Festival and water chestnut cakes on Chinese New Year, Tang Yuan or sticky rice ball is a traditional Chinese dessert served every Lantern Festival. The Lantern Festival is celebrated every 15th day of the first month of the lunar new year. 
Tang yuan is a type of Chinese dessert typically made with glutinous rice flour, shaped into round balls, and filled with sweet or savory fillings. My kids especially like the sweet sesame filling. This is also the year of rabbit. So I added a few ears to make the tang yuan/sweet rice balls look like cute little rabbits. 
Before ushering the coming new year, the Chinese always celebrates the Dongzhi festival (冬至) which is a very important event in the Chinese calendar. It is a time when family members hold a reunion and gather together to make and eat glutinous rice balls or Tang Yuan (汤圆) which literally means “round dumplings in sweet soup” to mark  
Divide the dough. Divide the dough in half, and roll each half into logs about 1 inch thick. Then cut each log into 10 equal-sized pieces for a total of 20 pieces. 
The sweet glutinous rice balls are sticky and chewy with a similar texture to mochi. They consist of two parts — the skin and the filling — and are served in a sweet ginger broth. Tang yuan range in size from a marble to a ping-pong ball and come either plain or stuffed with a filling like peanuts, red bean, or ground black sesame (the most  
A dish made of rice balls (tang yuan) is usually served during lunar new year. The texture is soft, somewhat sticky and chewy. The glutinous rice balls are usually made as plain white balls, filled with a filling such as black sesame, red bean or peanut paste or in my household, just colored for panache. 
Tangyuan are made very much like dumplings—a glutinous rice flour (i.e. ground sticky rice) dough forms a wrapper, and the filling goes inside the wrapper. Yuanxiao, on the other hand, involves taking a firm ball or cube of filling, and then placing it in a container of glutinous rice flour. 
Tang yuan soup. Cut the ingredients of the tang yuan soup into consistent sizes of about 2-2.5" (5-6 cm) in length. The meat should be 1/4" (.5 cm) thick and the vegetables should be 1/2" (1.25 cm) thick. 
Instructions To make the peanut filling. Make the filling a day before you want to make the tang yuan.. In a dry frying pan, add the peanuts and toast over medium heat, for 3-5 minutes, until aromatic. 
Yuanxiao, or sweet rice balls, are traditionally eaten on Lantern Festival, which is the last day of the two-week Chinese New Year holiday.Lantern Festival falls on the first full moon of the new year and people traditionally go out on the street at night carrying lanterns, and light fireworks and visit friends and family. 
Chinese New Year is tomorrow. In Chinese tradition, at least from what I know, tonight is the dinner for the end of the year. All family members should get together and enjoy a meal. In this meal, we should always end with the perfect sweet treat, which is the glutinous rice ball. The round shape of the glutinous rice balls symbolize the family  
Tangyuan (湯圓) and family: two things that always come to mind when I return home for the holidays. Tangyuan, or glutinous rice balls, is a Chinese dessert traditionally served during the Lantern Festival or Chinese New Year. The rice balls typically contain sweet filling, and they are boiled in water. 
Step 1 Make the filling: In a small food processor, add sugar, sesame or peanuts, and salt and pulse until mixture resembles coarse sand. Add in oil and water and continue blending until fully  
These are easy to make, very hearty, and perfect for sharing. This is a dish you’ll commonly find served during the Lunar New Year, celebrations, birthdays, and even at dim sum restaurants. These vegan Pearl Balls or Chinese Sticky Rice Pearl Meatballs are made with plant-based ground meat. 
Are you craving something chewy and sweet but also good for you, too? Look no further than this homemade Taro Tang Yuan 汤圆 - a delightful and easy-to-make dessert made with just 4 ingredients: taro, mochiko flour, sugar and hot water. These gluten-free and vegan rice balls are so easy to make, and offer a lovely combination of flavors and textures thanks to the sweet taro paste filling. 
While nobody needs a reason to eat sweet and sticky rice balls served hot on a cold winter night, tang yuan is generally eaten in the company of family on the 15th and final day of the Chinese New Year, also known as Lunar New Year festivities, when the Lantern Festival takes place. 
Cultural Context: Glutinous rice balls are eaten during the Chinese New Year mainly because of its auspicious name and shape. For many Chinese families in mainland China as well as overseas, glutinous rice balls are typically eaten together with family. The round shape of the balls and the bowls in which they are served symbolizes family cohesion. </p>
