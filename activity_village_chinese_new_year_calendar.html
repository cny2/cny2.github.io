The seventh day of the Lunar New Year (February 4, 2025) is said to be when the Chinese mother goddess, Nuwa, created humanity. Thus, it’s called renri/jan jat (the people’s birthday). 
The Snake is the 6th animal in the order of the Chinese zodiac, and every 12th year is named for this intelligent animal. In 2025, the new year starts on January 29. Here is the order of the animals in the Chinese zodiac: rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, snake, horse, goat, monkey, rooster, dog, and pig. 
What are the animals of the zodiac? Each year honors an animal based on the Chinese zodiac. The circle of 12 animals — the rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, goat, monkey, rooster, dog and pig — measure the cycles of time. 
In 2025, Chinese New Year begins on January 29th and ends on February 12th with the Lantern Festival. Traditionally, the start of the Chinese New Year calendar is 'The Laba Festival' (腊八节 Làbājié), which occurs about three weeks before Chinese New Year's Day and is celebrated separately. 
Chinese paper cuts are an ancient craft and tradition - and here at Activity Village is a tradition that we do one every year for Chinese New Year. Scroll down to find instructions and a template to produce 2 variations of this rat paper cut. 
We've got 15 common words for Chinese New Year in this set of word cards, designed to be quick and easy to cut out. Use them on their own or combine them with other Chinese New Year vocabulary printables. 
Lots NEW! Here you will find a collection of fun Chinese New Year puzzles for kids of all ages - from boggler puzzles to mazes to word searches to codes and more! We also have collections for each of the 12 animals of the Chinese zodiac, which you can find through the links here. 
Use this Chinese Characters Number Poster to brighten up the walls of the classroom or home at Chinese New Year or for counting activities. The poster prints out well on bright-coloured paper or card. 
Here's our collection of free Chinese scrapbook paper designs to print for scrapbooking, crafts for Chinese New year, gift wrapping, and other projects at home and in the classroom. You could make party hats, napkin rings and ang pow money envelopes (red packets) for a Chinese New Year dinner, or perhaps cut them into small rectangles and fold for gift tags, or long rectangles for bookmarks  
Keep the kids busy this Chinese New Year with our collection of fun Chinese New Year and Chinese zodiac themed word search puzzles. We've kept the words and fonts child-appropriate and they all have bright illustrations to keep the kids interested. 
This writing frame comes in lined and handwriting versions and makes a striking background for some Chinese New Year writing in the Year of the Ox, 2021. Write a forecast for the year, think about goals, research the characteristics of people born in the Year of the Ox  
There are 10 bingo cards and 1 calling card in this Chinese New Year bingo set, so the whole family or a big group of kids can join in the fun. And it's a great way to learn about the symbols of Chinese New Year, too, of course!
