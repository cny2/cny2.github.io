        <h2><strong>steamed coconut chinese new year cake chinese new year dance celebration</strong></h2>
        <p>This is another interesting way to use Nian Gao: Steamed Nian Gao with Coconut. Rolled in white and palm sugar coconut, these onde-onde like coconut balls are chewy and sweet, filled with coconut aroma. A perfect snack for the lunar new year or anytime around the year. 
Celebrate Lunar New Year with nian gao (年糕), a steamed rice cake made of glutinous rice flour and brown sugar. This is based on Mama Lin's recipe. I made a slight modification by adding ground ginger to the batter to give the nian gao more flavor. My favorite way of enjoying this cake is slicing it into thin pieces and pan frying them in oil. 
Directions To Cook. Place sugar, palm sugar, knotted pandan leaves and water in a pot and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Remove pandan leaves, strain and set aside to cool. 
The lunar new year is around the corner. Like last year we will be making some special snacks to welcome the new year. Today, we will learn how to make Chinese new years cake, also known as nian gao 年糕. Nian gao is made with glutinous rice flour which gives the nian gao a sticky and chewy texture. 
The Chinese new year is around the corner and I plan to end the year by making a lovely steamed Nian Gao recipe. Every year, Chinese people worldwide celebrate their new year with a traditional dessert called “Nian Gao cake.” It’s a type of sticky rice cake that has been enjoyed for centuries and is said to bring good luck for the coming  
Nian Gao Recipe Instructions. Prepare two 8-inch round baking pans by brushing the insides with vegetable oil.. Add 2 cups of water and the ginger to a medium-sized pot, bring it a boil, then let it simmer for 10 minutes over low to medium heat with the lid covered. 
Coconut milk: Even though you won’t taste the coconut, using unsweetened coconut milk as some of the liquid keeps the nian gao soft and adds richness. Salt and vanilla extract: I like a touch of salt to bring the flavors together, and a little bit of vanilla extract, too (although that’s optional). 
Steamer VS instant pot method: As I remembered, my uncles and aunts made sweet nian gao for Chinese New Year. They used their hands to mix the glutinous rice flour and sugar into a paste-like texture and pour them into a container with banana leaves, then steaming them over the stove for 1-1.5 hours depending on how deep the pan you use. 
During Chinese New Year, it has been a habit that this cake is prepared in advance of the Festival and stored in fridge, which will then be pan-fried and served as required. Before frying, however, it is better to sit the chilled cake at room temperature for a while. 
Glutinous rice cake or kuih bakul is significant to the Chinese community especially during Chinese New Year. It is made up of three ingredients namely glutinous rice flour, sugar and water. Although the steps are very easy, it requires a long time to cook. For the full recipe to making your own kuih bakul, check out the recipe here. 
Method:. Preheat oven to 180C/350F. Beat the eggs and mix with sugar very well. Add coconut milk and glutinous flour, and combine until very smooth. 
Instructions: 1. Make red bean paste.Cook red beans (in the Instant Pot or stovetop) until soft and creamy. Transfer to a food processor and pulse until pureed. 
The recipe below is for the plain, traditional steamed cake. (Another steamed cake that is often enjoyed at Chinese New Year is turnip cake. See my improved recipe here.) Photo below: Slices of the nian gao are coated in raw egg and pan fried in a little bit of oil. But some people prefer to omit the egg and pan fry the nian gao directly in the  
Method:. Use a saucepan to bring 1 cup of water to boil. Add brown sugar and cook until completely dissolved. Stir in coconut cream and oil. Drain syrup through a fine sieve to make the mixture smoother. 
Baked nian gao is a surprisingly easy Chinese glutinous rice cake dessert that is chewy, lightly sweetened, and has a lightly crusty coconut top! The soft red bean paste filling adds an extra delicious layer. Baked nian gao (烤年糕) is a classic Chinese new year rice cake dessert. It is extremely quick and easy and quickly makes a large batch, 
Nian gao, or Chinese New Year cake is a fantastic steamed cake typically enjoyed during Lunar New Year celebrations.Made from glutinous rice flour, when served warm it has a sticky, chewy texture that's similar to mochi. 
Special equipment: If you don’t have a large bamboo steamer, create your own steamer.Take two 24-inch-long pieces of aluminum foil and loosely roll and crumple each one widthwise into a 1-inch  
BAKED CHINESE STICKY RICE CAKE (BAKED MOCHI CAKE) My life is seriously changed forever after I tried this baked nian gao. All these years, I’ve been making steamed nian gao and it’s a must in our house to celebrate Chinese New Year. The Chinese wants to start the year (nian) high (gao) 😉 I decided I need to try the baked version. 
The Coconut and Red Bean Chinese New Year Rice Cake is an exciting twist on tradition, with layers of coconut and red bean bringing a rich flavor profile to the chewy rice base. This unique rice cake offers a delightful texture and a sweet surprise in every bite, making it a crowd-pleaser during festive gatherings. 
Soft and chewy Chinese New Year steamed cake with a flavor of pumpkin. You only need 4 ingredients to make this cake. It can be steamed or pressure cooked. The cake is naturally gluten-free.
