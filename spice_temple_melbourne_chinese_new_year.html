Spice Temple was a major disappointment for my partner &amp; I for the following reasons : 1.Having booked 5/6 weeks earlier we were seated @ the back of the Restuarant in the middle of 3 sets of 2 seating with one of us facing the Restuarant &amp; the other the dark wall of the building.2.5 of our Banquet dishes arrived @ once whereas the tables beside us arrived I-2 @ a time.3.Whilst the food was ok  
Overlooking the Yarra River and city skyline, Spice Temple’s deep, rich-toned interiors spell evocative and inviting. Founded on the philosophy of faultless service and a deep respect for high quality produce, the culinary focus is regional China and the different provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangxi and Xinjiang.
