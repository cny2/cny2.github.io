        <p>The time for handing out red envelopes is from the first to the fifteenth day of each Lunar New Year, and because it’s the lunar calendar, the calendar dates will vary from year to year. After the 15th day, you’re officially home free. 
Chinese New Year red envelopes are a traditional gift for children or elderly people during Chinese New Year. In China, the red envelope (money) is called ya sui qian (压岁钱 /yaa sway chyen/), which means 'suppressing Sui [the demon]money'. Those who receive a red envelope are wished another safe and peaceful year. Generally, on Chinese New  
4. Ensure the lucky money is crisp and new. When giving money ensure it is crisp and new. People across China will spend the weeks preceding Chinese New Year withdrawing crisp notes from the bank. It is considered a sign of disrespect to give old or torn notes. 5. Always start by presenting a gift to the oldest (or most senior) member. 
During the new year season, the giving should only be within the fifteen days of Chinese New Year celebration (from New Year’s Eve to Lantern Festival), not before or after. Give and receive lai see with both hands; it is impolite if you do it with one hand only. Do not attempt to open the envelope in front of the giver; this is also impolite. 
It’s traditional to leave a red envelope with two tangerines (leaves on, of course) by a child’s bedside on New Year’s Eve. Given that Chinese New Year isn’t celebrated with material gifts, the amount is usually around $20, enough for the child to buy a toy on his or her own. 
Chinese people believe that good things should be in pairs, so the presents should not be in odd number. For example, liquor is usually given in two bottles, and cigarettes in two cartons. If you are going to give a red envelope, the amount of the money should be an integer or an auspicious number like 6 and 8. Here are some examples of the  
People prefer to receive lucky money in lucky amounts. You may wonder what amount will be regarded as auspicious. In the northern region of China, the integral and even number amount are popular, such as 100, 200, 500, 800 and 1000 whereas sums such as 250, 400 or 740 should be avoided. 
Happy New Year! Wish you success in school! Hope you have a great year! It’s best to make sure the parents see you give the money. Some parents like to take their children’s lucky money and put it in savings accounts. It prevents children from wasting or losing it. Be genuine when giving red envelopes to your own parents. 
This year’s Chinese New Year falls on Feb 10. One of the things that everyone associates with Chinese New Year is hongbao (红包) — money-filled red packets given to family, friends, colleagues, and employees. Every year around this time, I always find myself checking in with others about how much to put in the envelopes. 
Lunar New Year is around the corner, this year falling on January 22. On this day, the Year of the Tiger closes and we will begin the Year of the Rabbit — the fourth sign of the Chinese zodiac  
What do you think people are supposed to do with it then lol? I can guarantee no one in my family (or anyone else’s for that matter) sets aside their Chinese New Year money to give to someone else next year — that would make zero sense. It’s a gift, the best way to show gratitude is to use it for something you enjoy. 
In Portugal and Latin America, they follow the tradition of putting money in your shoe on NYE. Stepping on money on New Year’s Eve can bring good fortune for the New Year. It's not bad luck to spend money on NYE, as this money should be used towards your first purchase in the New Year, which brings luck and wealth throughout the year. ‍ 5. 
Money should not be lent on New Year's Day, and all debts have to be paid by New Year's Eve, and, if someone owes you money, do not go to his or her home to demand it. Anyone who does so it is said will be unlucky all the year. 16. Don't wear damaged clothes. Do not wear clothes that are damaged. 
During Chinese New Year, people have a long list of things to do. From one week preceding the festival to the 15th day after, many Chinese New Year customs are widely observed for thousands of years. From one week preceding the festival to the 15th day after, many Chinese New Year customs are widely observed for thousands of years. 
Forget spending your lai see money on things you don’t actually need. Instead, try saving, investing or donating some of your Lunar New Year cash. 
Otoshidama – Japanese New Year‘s gifts of cash for children . Eidi – South Asian money gifts in ornamental envelopes for Eid al-Fitr. Mtawwad – Moroccan wooden boxes with cash inside exchanged between Sufis. Pottah – Thai New Year‘s good luck money envelopes . Pongal – Hindu Tamil harvest festival using turmeric rice gift packets 
Do not wear black or white at Chinese New Year – they are associated with mourning – don’t get a haircut, and if you will wear new shoes, buy them early You’re definitely not going to get the red-carpet treatment if you choose to wear black on Chinese New Year.
