Unpopular opinion here, but I’ve always felt that Mei was never fat. She only looks chubby because of the snow clothes she wears.

I'm Chinese and I'm not offended in the slightest. Hell, most characters have a Chinese themed skin. "Cultural appropriation" being offensive is a western idea.

There's a bug with Mei's Luna and Chang'e skins right now that's causing her waist to appear much smaller than normal. We've already fixed the bug internally, but it's going to require a patch to implement (ideally it'll be included in whatever next patch hits your gaming platform). Thanks for the quick reports, btw.
