        <p>HOUSTON – In celebration of the Chinese New Year, the Houston Rockets will honor their largest international fan base by wearing a specially designed uniform with Chinese characters in three  
Houston, TX – Houston Rockets Owner Leslie Alexander announced today that the team will wear specially designed Lunar New Year uniforms to celebrate the Chinese New Year with its largest  
Lastly, after years of the Rockets paying homage to their deep Chinese fanbase with their Lunar New Year “City Edition” jerseys, they decided it was time to pay homage to the city’s history  
When the Rockets drafted Yao in 2002, it was like opening Pandora's Box of Chinese basketball fans. Suddenly, the NBA had a whole new audience of millions. More Than Just a Jersey. To capitalize on this newfound fame (and let's be real, money), the Rockets decided to embrace their Chinese fan base. Enter the Chinese New Year jerseys. 
The Houston Rockets will wear special uniforms to celebrate the Chinese New Year this February, furthering the franchise's embrace of Chinese culture and developing its brand in Asia's most NBA

The Rockets will wear their jerseys Jan. 27 to kick off Chinese New Year. Nine teams will host themed activities during the timespan: the Wolves, Sixers, Cavs, Kings, Nets, Warriors, Wizards  
Last year, the Golden State Warriors and Houston Rockets reached out to their fanbase in China by paying tribute to the dawning of a new Chinese Lunar New Year by wearing jerseys with the wordmark  
In addition to all the festivities, Chinese legend Yao Ming will have his number 11 jersey retired for the Houston Rockets during the halftime show of a matchup against the Chicago Bulls on February 3rd. With basketball being as big as it is in China, the NBA is doing it right and paying tribute to our overseas fellow hoop fanatics. 
The Houston Rockets continue to market the NBA to China, revealing new Chinese Lunar New Year uniforms this afternoon. 
&lt;p&gt;Celebrate the Chinese New Year with this officially licensed James Harden Houston Rockets red jersey. The jersey features the Nike Swingman design and is made for men in size 44. It is perfect for basketball fans who want to show their support for the team during regular season games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jersey is made of high-quality materials and features the Houston Rockets team logo on the

Sure, Yao was nothing short of great and we have a huge amount of Chinese fans but if we have Chinese themed jerseys, why not have Kwanza themed jerseys too, since the majority of our players are African-American? Don't get me wrong, I appreciate racial diversity but as an American-Pakistani, why not have Urdu-themed jersey as well? 
The Rockets will be the first team to wear the fresh new threads in a January 27th matchup against the Philadelphia 76ers. All four teams will have worn their jerseys at least once during a 17-day span beginning January 26th, in honor of the New Year starting two days later. 
Yes but the idea is to sell the jerseys, one has to assume China is the main demo for these jerseys. If the Chinese population can not access them then whats the point. Not to mention the Chinese New year has no relation with the city of Houston so it was a money grab to begin with. 
Celebrate Chinese New Year with this exclusive Houston Rockets Adidas Jersey featuring the iconic #12 of Dwight Howard. Made for male fans, this jersey is perfect for basketball enthusiasts who love to show their support for the team. 
In honor of the Chinese New Year, the franchise introduced this red sleeved alternate displaying 'The Rockets' written in chinese on the front. It celebrates the global popularity the NBA and the many foreign stars who have been apart of its history. 
The Houston Rockets, who previously drafted and welcomed retired NBA international superstar Yao Ming, will be the second team donning special Chinese New Year uniforms this year. A solid red body  
Today, the Houston Rockets annouced they will once again wear a uniform with Chinese characters to celebrate the Chinese New Year. The Rocket will wear the uniform in three games: Feb. 6 vs. the Portland Trail Blazers, Feb. 9 vs. Golden State Warriors and Feb. 10 at Portland. </p>
