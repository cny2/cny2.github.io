        <p>If the seller does not respond during the Chinese New Year holiday, AliExpress will automatically step in to resolve the dispute. Order Lead Time: Orders with a standard processing time of 7 days may experience delays until after the holiday period. 
Chinese New Year marks the turning point of the traditional lunisolar Chinese calendar – the new moon at the midpoint of the winter solstice and spring equinox. This year’s expected Chinese New Year falls on February 10, which precedes two weeks of Chinese New Year celebrations. Chinese New Year 2024 will begin on Saturday, February 10, 2024. 
One is the traditional Lunar New Year holiday, which usually lasts for 7-10 days, and the other is the National Day holiday, which usually lasts for 5-8 days. For example, now is the National Day holiday in China, and many sellers have a delivery delay of 1-2 days compared to usual. 
The annual Chinese New Year factories’ shutting down and resulting shipping delays present significant challenges for businesses, but proactive planning can make all the difference. In 2025, these disruptions are further amplified by the Red Sea crisis, which is increasing transit times and shipping costs. 
While shopping during Chinese New Year can be rewarding, it’s essential to remain practical about potential delays in both shipping and customer service responses. Impact on AliExpress Operations The Chinese New Year significantly impacts the operations of AliExpress as many sellers and suppliers take time off to celebrate. 
Holiday &amp; Seller Delays Because many AliExpress products ship from China, Chinese holidays that close or limit postal and customs services can increase the shipping time. The most notable holiday is Chinese New Year, which is usually celebrated for one to two weeks in late January and/or early February. [12] 
How to Avoid Lunar New Year Shipping Delays in 2025. Lunar New Year 2025, also known as Chinese New Year or the Spring Festival, is right around the corner. For importers and exporters, the holiday means limited operations, labor shortages, and delayed shipping. But you can avoid the holiday rush and supply chain disruptions.

By leveraging innovative parcel tracking solutions and staying informed about shipment status, shoppers can navigate through the holiday season with confidence, ensuring that their online

By following these strategies and leveraging the power of Easyship, you can ensure your online business continues to thrive even during the Chinese New Year shipping slowdown. 
February 5 is Chinese New Year. This is the time of the year most businesses in China close down and people travel to their home town to celebrate. This has a lot of consequences for AliExpress shoppers and you should know about this. Between now and Feb 3 many stores shut down and stop shipping orders. Suppliers also stop producing goods. 
Chinese New Year starts on February 12 and lasts until February 22, 2021. This is the time of the year most businesses in China close down to celebrate. This has a lot of consequences for AliExpress shoppers and you should know about this: 
Please mind that Chinese New Year’s Eve in 2023 is on January 21st, and the holiday itself, Chinese New Year’s Day in 2023, starts on January 22nd. The dates for the next years are: 2023 Chinese New Year – January 22nd; 2024 Chinese New Year – February 10th; 2025 Chinese New Year – January 29th

Chinese New Year (or Spring Festival) lasts from January 24 until January 30 2020. However, many Chinese people leave their work a week early, starting right about now. During this period most Aliexpress shops will not ship goods and manufacturers do not supply shops. Processing times are generally extended up to + 3 weeks because of this. 
Chinese New Year is the most important festival in China. CNY 2022 is on Feb 1. National holiday Jan 31 - Feb 6, and the festival will officially end on Feb 15. Even though it's still 2 weeks from now, the impacts has already started. Just several hours ago, the CNY travel rush has officially begun.
