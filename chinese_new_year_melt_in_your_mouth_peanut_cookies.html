Like these Chinese New Year Peanut Cookies, Chinese New Year Almond Cookies, and other straightforward and butter-free nut cookies, and Hup Toh Soh (Walnut biscuits). This recipe for cashew nut cookies is one of my favorites because it only calls for a mixing bowl and requires no creaming of the butter and sugar. 
Pull out your all purpose flour, icing sugar (important for that melt-in-your-mouth texture mentioned), good quality peanut butter ( I use Skippy smooth PB), salt and peanut or vegetable oil – and you’re good to go. Peanut oil would be best so as to enhance the peanut flavour in the cookie.

Peanut cookie is one of my favorite Chinese New Year cookies. I grew up helping my late aunt making hundreds of peanut cookiesshaping them into round balls. Next, I used the cap of a toothpaste to form the circle pattern on top of each cookie. 
I make these cookies a few times a year, not just Chinese New Year because they are so easy to make. Also, you only need a few ingredients and blanched peanuts is something I always have in my pantry. Many people have affirmed that these cookies have a melt-in-the-mouth texture because of the use of rice flour and powdered/icing sugar. 
5. Lightly press in one half of a peanut right in the center of each piece of shaped dough. 6. Using a silicone brush, glaze each of them with the beaten egg, neat and thorough. </p>
