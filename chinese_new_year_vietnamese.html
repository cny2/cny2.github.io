        <p>Chinese New Year and the Vietnamese New Year (called Tết in Vietnam) actually have a lot in common. What we can be sure of is that Lunar New Year holidays are always about dedicating time for family, gatherings, gifts and hoping for the best for the New Year to come. 
No Tết celebration is complete without a mention of the Vietnamese zodiac. Like its Chinese counterpart, the Vietnamese zodiac is a 12-year cycle where each year is associated with an animal. However, Vietnam adds its own unique twist to this tradition. The Rabbit is replaced by the Cat, believed to bring a sense of calmness and prosperity. 
Tết is generally celebrated on the same day as Chinese New Year (also called Spring Festival), with the one-hour time difference between Vietnam and China resulting in the new moon occurring on different days.

The Vietnamese lunar calendar follows a 12-year cycle, with each year represented by an animal. While similar to the Chinese Zodiac, the Vietnamese version includes the cat (instead of the rabbit) and the water buffalo (instead of the ox). 
Normally, the Lunar New Year festival in Asian countries (such as China, Korea, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, etc.) happens on the same date. Yet, there may be differences due to time zone offsets. For example, the Chinese Lunar New Year will be 1 hour or 1 day later than the Vietnamese Lunar New Year. 
Along with many other Asian countries, both the Chinese and the Vietnamese recognize the Lunar calendar as part of their cultural tradition. It's a calendar that incorporates a zodiac of twelve animals in rotation. As a new lunar new year begins, the "year" of a new animal also begins. On January 29, 2025, we will start the Year of the Snake. 
1. New Year's Eve dinner: During the Chinese New Year, fish is usually served for the New Year's Eve dinner, which means "abundance every year".
