        <p>Nian Gao Recipe Instructions. Prepare two 8-inch round baking pans by brushing the insides with vegetable oil.. Add 2 cups of water and the ginger to a medium-sized pot, bring it a boil, then let it simmer for 10 minutes over low to medium heat with the lid covered. 
Celebrate Lunar New Year with nian gao (年糕), a steamed rice cake made of glutinous rice flour and brown sugar. This is based on Mama Lin's recipe. I made a slight modification by adding ground ginger to the batter to give the nian gao more flavor. My favorite way of enjoying this cake is slicing it into thin pieces and pan frying them in oil. 
In a small saucepan, melt 250g cane sugar, 60g brown sugar in pieces in 1½ cup of cold water slowly over medium heat. Pro Tip #1 – To Speed Up the Process: break down the sugar pieces once the water starts to warm. 
This EASY Chinese New Year Cake Recipe, or Baked Nian Gao, is sweet, sticky, and gooey with that mochi-like consistency when piping hot. (It's also delicious pan-fried.) Traditionally, Nian Gao is steamed but that takes forever, and you have to add the right amount of water for the New Year Cake to come out right. 
Chinese Lunar New Year won’t be complete without Nian Gao or Chinese New Year rice cake. It is made from glutinous rice flour, cornstarch, and wheat starch, giving you a soft and sticky treat. This recipe also uses brown sugar, ginger, and coconut milk for a sweet and creamy taste! 
Step 4 Steam the nian gao Here are the steps. Pour the mixture into the mold line with the banana leaves. Cover the molds with aluminum foil.; Set up a steaming station.

Often, Chinese people make and consume it especially during lunar new year. This nian gao recipe is tasty, simple and easy with an instant pot and stove top method. 
Allergy Friendly Steamed Rice Cake. I am excited to share this particular recipe because nian gao is vegan, gluten-free, and free of the top 9 allergens, whoo-hoo!. And I was thrilled to find out that my mom’s favorite sweet rice flour by Koda Farms. is produced in a rice only facility that is free of the top 8 allergens, gluten free, and GMO free. 
The Chinese new year is around the corner and I plan to end the year by making a lovely steamed Nian Gao recipe. Every year, Chinese people worldwide celebrate their new year with a traditional dessert called “Nian Gao cake.” 
This is an easy simplified recipe to make Caramel Nian Gao (年糕). This sweet delicacy is also known as Sticky Rice Cake, Kuih Bakul or Chinese New Year cake. Only simple ingredients needed and only 2 hours of steaming to enjoy this auspicious rice cake. This homemade Nian Gao is so delicious and perfect as gifts too. So let’s start cooking!

All these years, I’ve been making steamed nian gao and it’s a must in our house to celebrate Chinese New Year. The Chinese wants to start the year (nian) high (gao) 😉 I decided I need to try the baked version. This baked nian gao, YOU MUST TRY! I mean it! Even if you don’t celebrate Chinese New Year, this naturally gluten-free cake  
This quick and easy recipe will take your classic Nian Gao (Chinese New Year rice cake) to another level by adding additional ingredients for extra flavour. It tastes great either as it is or pan-fried. 
Nian Gao (年糕) or Chinese New Year Cake is often eaten during Lunar New Year for its auspicious name. "Nian" means year and "Gao" means cake. However, the same word in a different character means high or tall. This special treat is often gifted to family and friends to bring wishes for a better year. 
Nian Gao and Chinese New Year. Sometimes referred to as "Chinese New Year cake", this is a popular dessert for Lunar New Year celebrations in many Asian countries, bringing good luck for the coming year. Here are some of the ways Nian Gao relates to the Lunar New Year Celebration. The name itself is actually a pun using the Chinese character  
Make our family’s traditional Pan Fried Nian Gao Recipe (New Year Cake) to celebrate Chinese New Year. This smooth and sweet gooey rice cake wrapped with crisp fragrant layer of egg is so delicious to eat! 
Nian gao, 年糕, is Chinese for "year cake" or "new year cake". This Chinese new year cake is a sweet rice cake that is traditionally eaten during the lunar new year celebrations. Nian gao is directly translated to sticky cake , "nian" meaning sticky and "gao" meaning cake. 
Fried Nian Gao, Taro, Sweet Potato Spring Rolls (Air-Fryer Version) Fried Nian Gao Sweet Potato Balls. Fried Nian Gao Sweet Potato Sandwich. Super Easy Baked Nian Gao Puff Pastry (3 filling combo) Pan-fried Nian Gao with Egg. If you don’t want to do this traditional steamed nian gao, you MUST try this Baked Chinese New Year Sweet Nian Gao. So  
Chewy rice cakes, in many forms both sweet and savory, are popular in several Asian cuisines. The sticky rice cake dessert, Nian Gao, is not the same as the chewy rice cake ovalettes, also called Nian Gao, that are stir-fried in Shanghai cuisine. (Confused yet?) My baked Nian Gao is dense and chewy, similar to the texture of a soft gummy bear. 
Why this recipe works. Using brown sugar slabs adds a rich caramel color to the Nian Gao.; A combination of glutinous rice flour and wheat starch steams into a rice cake with a wonderfully soft and chewy texture. </p>
