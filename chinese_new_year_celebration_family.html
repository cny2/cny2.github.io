        <p>Chinese New Year begins with a reunion dinner on New Year’s Eve that gathers family from far and wide, much in the same way Americans celebrate Thanksgiving. During the two weeks of celebration that follow, the feasting continues as friends and family share good tidings for the year ahead. 
One of the most significant parts of the Chinese New Year 2025 celebration is spreading love and sincere wishes to your family, friends, colleagues, and all the people you meet.

During Chinese New Year, people have a long list of things to do. From one week preceding the festival to the 15th day after, many Chinese New Year customs are widely observed for thousands of years. The family reunion dinner, eating dumplings, and setting off firework are the must-dos that you might know. What else interesting do the Chinese do? 
Family ties are central to Chinese New Year traditions. The most important celebration happens on Chinese New Year’s Eve, when families gather together for a reunion. Traditionally, the family travels to the 老家 (lǎojiā), the old home or ancestral home, to celebrate with paternal grandparents. 
The 15th day of the Chinese New Year is the Lantern Festival (元宵节 yuán xiāo jié). It traditionally marks the end of the Chinese New Year celebration. On this day, popular activities include lighting up lanterns, guessing lantern riddles, eating yuan xiao (a kind of rice ball), and enjoying time with families or lovers. 
The family reunion dinner, Chinese New Year TV gala and staying up all night on its Eve are also traditional festivities. Similar to the Christmas dinner in western countries, the New Year reunion dinner has significant meaning to Chinese people, because it is the time that all family members reunite together. 
Other countries celebrate Chinese New Year because they have a community around them that does. Some families have members who practice it, and they get to see different Chinese New Year celebrations. Like most celebrations and traditions, this holiday is often celebrated on Chinese New Year’s Eve with food, fun, and family. 
Chinese New Year celebration is not exclusive to immediate family members, but among all relatives and friends. Married couples should visit the wife’s parents on the second day of the New Year. During the following days, people visit different relatives, bringing gifts and red envelopes to express care, love, and good wishes.
