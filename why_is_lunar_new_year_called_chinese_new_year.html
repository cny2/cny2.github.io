        <h2><strong>why is lunar new year called chinese new year chinese new year food and drink</strong></h2>
        <p>Every year, the Lunar New Year marks the transition from one animal to another. The Year of the Dragon, which began on Feb. 10, 2024, ended Tuesday to begin the Year of the Snake. 
Simply put, Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year are not the same. Despite being related, there are a few noteworthy differences between the two. Read on to find out what they are. The Differences between Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year 1. "Chinese New Year" is specific while "Lunar New Year" is more general. 
The holiday is sometimes called the Lunar New Year because the dates of celebration follow the phases of the moon. Since the mid-1990s people in China have been given seven consecutive days off work during the Chinese New Year. 
The festival is also called "Lunar New Year" in English, despite the traditional Chinese calendar being lunisolar and not lunar. However, "Chinese New Year" is still a commonly-used translation for people of non-Chinese backgrounds. [20] 
Chinese New Year specifically refers to the festival in China. Lunar New Year is a broader term for similar celebrations across Asia. Both are based on lunar calendars, but the Chinese calendar dictates the timing of Chinese New Year. 
Why Lunar New Year prompts the world’s largest annual migration. Observed by billions of people, the festival also known as Chinese New Year or Spring Festival is marked by themes of reunion and  
Lunar New Year, festival typically celebrated in China and other Asian countries that begins with the first new moon of the lunar calendar and ends on the first full moon of the lunar calendar, 15 days later. The dates of the holiday vary from year to year, beginning some time between January 21 and February 20. 
Chinese New Year, also known as the Lunar New Year or the Spring Festival, is the most important among the traditional Chinese festivals. The origin of the Chinese New Year Festival can be traced back to about 3,500 years ago. Chinese New Year has evolved over a long period of time and its customs have undergone a long development process. 
Why is it called the “Lunar” New Year? The term “lunar” is an English adaptation, mainly because the holiday starts with the new moon, ends with the full moon 14 days later, and is thus based on the Chinese lunisolar calendar. The name of the holiday in Chinese, 春节 Chūnjié, literally translates to “Spring Festival”. 
In the United States of America, "Lunar New Year" is strongly associated with Chinese Americans and "Chinese New Year" is commonly used as a translation by people of non-Chinese backgrounds. [4] [8] Chinese New Year is the official name of the celebration and holiday in some countries such as Singapore, [9] Brunei, [10] and Malaysia. [11] 
'Spring Festival' refers to the same festival more commonly known in English as the 'Chinese New Year'. It is the biggest festival in China. Spring Festival 2025 falls on Wednesday, Jan 29th, 2025, beginning a year of the Snake. 
Why does Chinese New Year fall on different dates? Rather than following the western Gregorian Calendar with 365-day years, the Chinese New Year follows a lunar calendar based the moon's 12 phases  
Rather than following the western Gregorian Calendar with 365-day years, the Chinese New Year follows a lunar calendar based the moon's 12 phases. Each phase cycle spans approximately 29 days with  
The Chinese New Year is also known as the Spring Festival. It is the biggest and most important festival in China and East Asian communities around the world. Now, let us know the do's and don'ts

Lunar New Year — also commonly called Chinese New Year — marks the start of the new year based on lunar calendars, or monthly cycles of the moon's phases. The lunar new year starts with the  
If you look up the Wikipedia page for Lunar New Year and compare it to the page for Chinese New Year, the page for Chinese New Year is at least five times longer, despite being the less general event. But generalizing Lunar New Year as Chinese New Year is more than just saying the wrong word and using the wrong name. 
The terms Lunar New Year and Chinese New Year are often used interchangeably. But it’s not the same. Although both celebrate the start of a new year according to the lunar calendar, they have different meanings, traditions, and cultural significance. 
What are the animals of the zodiac? Each year honors an animal based on the Chinese zodiac. The circle of 12 animals — the rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, goat, monkey, rooster, dog and pig — measure the cycles of time.
