        <p>Why didn’t Mei get a legendary skin for this event, you know, the Lunar New Year, the Chinese New year, the ONLY Chinese Hero? The one person who, understandably, would be the center focus of the event. But Mercy, the Swiss Heroine, the ethnical opposite of this entire event, got a legendary skin. Am I, like, missing something here 
Enter Year of the Rooster. Mei, being the only Chinese character in the game, got two skins for this event, two color variations of a traditional Chinese outfit that’s a bit less bulky than the  
Overwatch’s Year of the Rooster event went live on Tuesday, bringing with it a new capture the flag gameplay mode and a bunch of new skins and other cosmetics themed around the Chinese New Year  
TL;DR: Mei's Lunar skin has been chang'ed (see what I did there) to appear more thicker. This probably is because of some people's belief that Mei is actually as big as the coat she wears (despite it being highly inferred that she isn't that big). This change doesn't feel necessary but the issue isn't that big to cause a riot, just discussion. 
In Overwatch, the Lunar New Year cosmetics were cosmetics that could only be unlocked during the Lunar New Year event, either by logging in, completing limited time challenges, opening Lunar Loot boxes or purchasing them with Credits . In Overwatch 2, you can purchase any of the past event skins that were not part of weekly challenges from either the Hero Gallery with Credits and Coins (750  
The Lunar New Year event only has one new skin, a $10 Mei epic, which Overwatch 2 players aren't thrilled about. RELATED: Overwatch 2 Players Want A "Classic" Mode Inspired By The First Game What's more, this new skin is essentially a base recolour with a new hat, which isn't too surprising given that it's epic quality, but as it's the only new

Let's delve into the numbers, particularly the surge in “dragon babies”. In 2024, during the Year of the Dragon, China witnessed a 5.7% year-on-year increase in births, with South Korea seeing a 3% rise. These spikes are noteworthy, considering both nations are grappling with declining birth rates. 
Lunar New Year — which includes Chinese New Year, Seollal in Korea, Tet in Vietnam and more — begins on Jan. 29, kicking off more than two weeks of parties, customs and copious feasts. 
Would you even know about Chinese New Year without it? The outfit itself also allows Mei to show off her curves a bit more by accentuating them in a bold crimson. How to Get It: Only available as part of the Chinese New Year event, and legendary at that. You can wait for a loot box containing it or purchase it for 1000 credits. 
$20 a skin. theoretically, theh make money off these skins. So more skins means more people eager to buy. Who is busting down the doors for this mei skin? At least if there were a variety you cast a wider net. 
Nice and pure is Mercy's thing, and Witch is the complete opposite of that. But the Mercy Witch costume isn't scary, if anything it's sexy and has a certain fashionable aesthetic. Just like the Jiangshi isn't naturally cute, but Mei's costume of

I also wanted the pose to be more relaxed and inviting to the  
This is the fourth time that Mercy got the Lunar New Year skin which is teased in Season 8 trailer. Currently, she has three Lunar New Year skins in the gallery (Fortune -&gt; Zhuque -&gt; Seolbim). Meanwhile OW1 OG characters such as Soldier:76 and Symmetra are still missing a Lunar New Year Legendary skin. 
Lmao I'm Chinese and I didn't even know there's such a thing/belief. And I don't even care, now that I learned about it. Some of y'all need to calm down and stop being offended for us Chinese people. edit: New Mei skin is still #1. thicc thighs save lives </p>
