        <p>With a history of more than 1,800 years, dumpling (饺子 Jiǎozi /jyaoww-dzrr/) is a classic lucky food for Lunar New Year, and a traditional dish eaten on Chinese New Year's Eve, widely popular in China, especially in North China. 
Most Americans consider January 1 the start of the new year, but many Asians and Asian-Americans don’t. Instead, they follow Lunar New Year, also referred to as Chinese New Year in the U.S., which begins on January 29, 2025. (That’s the Year of the Snake in the Chinese zodiac, BTW.) 
“Ji” sounds like “lucky” in Chinese, making this dish a symbol of good fortune. A whole chicken signifies family unity and completeness, promising a harmonious year together. Whole Steamed Chicken, a centrepiece in Lunar New Year celebrations, goes beyond culinary delight to embody profound symbols of good fortune and family unity. 
Glutinous rice cake – Niangao is also a common New Year food, as its name sounds like “getting higher year-on-year,” a wish for prosperity. 2. Chow Mein Noodles. Longevity noodles (Chang Shou Mian / chung-show mien) are another unsurprising addition to the Chinese New Year table.

Green is a color associated with wealth and currency, so leafy greens like lettuce, spinach and bok choy are often served as a Chinese New Year food. During Chinese New Year, these foods are often included in stir fry, soups, spring rolls and salads. The hope is some of that promised prosperity will manifest in your new year. 6. Dumplings 
Another food you definitely want to put on your Chinese New Year food list for this Year of the Tiger is tang yuan — black sesame filled sweet rice balls that are typically served in a sweet soup.
