“And in 1998, some people who knew his interests asked him to make a small display at the Wonders Series,” Fish said. The collection was so well-received during the Imperial Tombs of Wonders exhibition, the Belz couple decided to make it permanent by donating pieces to the foundation that now runs the museum, once unofficially called the Jade Museum. 
The display was part of a complementary exhibit to the Wonders: Imperial Tombs of China exhibition taking place at the Cook Convention Center. By 1998 the foundation had been established and the museum was originally named Peabody Place Museum. Today, the collection at Belz Museum serves as a testament to their love of collecting. 
Located at 119 South Main, on the downstairs level of the Pembroke Square building, the Belz Museum of Asian and Judaic Art opened in 1998 as Peabody Place Museum and Gallery and held some 200 pieces of Chinese art. A decade later the Judaic section was added, the name was changed, and today, the museum features 1,400 works continually on display. 
The Year of the Dog officially begins on January 29, 2006. Family Day at Peabody Place Museum will feature traditional Chinese dancing, singing and arts and crafts projects for children. Winners from the museum’s “This Chinese New Year is for the Dogs” art contest will be announced. Special puppets donated from China will be on display. 
I highly recommend visiting this museum for anyone interested in art, culture, and history.” “The Belz Museum of Asian &amp; Judaic Art is an incredible hidden gem in Memphis. As I walked through the exhibits, I was struck by the diversity and beauty of the art on display.” “I was amazed and impressed at the collection this museum had. 
The official name of the museum was changed to Belz Museum of Asian &amp; Judaic Art to better reflect the scope and history of the collection. One of the newest editions was the Judaica Gallery, which was later unveiled in its entirety in 2004. The museum continues to host enriching events and offers student and adult programs throughout the year.

That year, Jack Belz had agreed to donate some of their collection to a temporary exhibition at the Pink Palace Museum in Memphis. The display was part of a complementary exhibit to the Wonders: Imperial Tombs of China exhibition taking place at the Cook Convention Center.
