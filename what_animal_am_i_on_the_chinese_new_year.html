A 15-day celebration, Chinese Lunar New Year continues until the full “Snow Moon” signals the beginning of the Lantern Festival on Wednesday, Feb. 12, 2025. 
The Chinese zodiac, known as Sheng Xiao or Shu Xiang, features 12 animal signs in this order: Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Sheep, Monkey, Rooster, Dog and Pig. 2025 is the Year of the Snake according to Chinese zodiac, starting from the 2025 Chinese New Year on Jan. 29th and lasting to 2026 Lunar New Year's Eve on Feb. 16. 2026  
Celebrate Chinese New Year 2025 from January 29 to February 12, marking the Year of the Wood Snake. Enjoy family gatherings, traditional dishes, and vibrant parades during this 15-day festival. 
Ox is the second animal in the 12-year cycle of the Chinese zodiac, coming after the Rat and before the Tiger.Recent years of the Ox include 2021, 2009, 1997, 1985, 1973, 1961, and 1949, with the next Ox year in 2033 (Year of the Water Ox). 
The Chinese Zodiac consists of 12 animals that signify each year, tracing their origins to a race set by the Jade Emperor. Each animal embodies distinct traits and is linked to five elements  
That’s because each year is represented by an animal, called a Chinese zodiac sign, and legend has it that people born under that sign have similar traits to the animal. (The year 2024—starting February 10—is the Year of the Dragon.) These ancient zodiac signs probably weren’t based on real animal species. 
However, what draws me to the Chinese zodiac is the cyclical evolution. I am not stuck forever as a rat. Rather, I am expected to grow and change in a multitude of ways through this 12-year cycle of animals and traits. I Versus We. Being a Westerner, I have grown up with setting individualistic goals or resolutions that are centered around me. 
Chinese New Year is a perfect time to introduce children to the fascinating traditions and stories of the Chinese Zodiac. The 12 animals each carry unique characteristics, making them an exciting topic for young Chinese learners. Here are some fun activities to help your kids learn more about thes 
According to the Chinese solar calendar, the Chinese New Year of the Yi Si or Wood Snake transition begins on February 3, 2025, at 11:10 p.m., when the planetary energy shifts. Stepping into 2025, change has settled around us, and we stand at a moment of profound possibility. </p>
