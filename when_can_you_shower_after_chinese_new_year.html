        <p>This year, Chinese New Year begins on Wednesday, January 29. Those who celebrate will be entering the year of the snake. Just like with any holiday, traditions abound for Chinese New Year. Some of Do not shower, sweep or throw out garbage on New Year’s Day: you don’t want to “wash out” or” throw away” good luck. 
Chinese people believe that, as the Spring Festival is the start of a new year, what you do then will affect your luck in the coming year. There are many Chinese New Year traditions about dos and don'ts. Find out the top 18 things you should not do. Some are taboos on the first day of the Chinese New Year and some are superstitions for the  
If you must, make sure to start at the outer edge of a room and sweep inwards. Bag up any garbage and throw it away after the fifth day. Similarly, you shouldn’t take a shower on Chinese New Year’s Day. 4. Do not use scissors, knives or other sharp objects. There are two reasons behind this rule. 
The Chinese word for “book” (shū) sounds exactly the same as the word for “lose” – so buying a book right after ringing in the New Year is considered an invitation for bad luck. 
Don’t Wash Your Hair or Clothes on New Year’s Day. Washing is thought to wash away wealth and blessings. Postpone laundry and hair-washing until after the first day. By following these traditions and avoiding the taboos, you can usher in a year full of prosperity, happiness, and good luck. Wishing you a joyous and auspicious Chinese New  
Some of those Chinese New Year taboos will only sustain for first few days of the festival, while others may be kept till the Lantern Festival on the 15th day of the 1st lunar month, or even for a whole month. Hereunder are 16 things you should never do during the Chinese New Year. 
How to observe Lunar New Year in three easy steps: Do not shower, sweep or throw out garbage on New Year’s Day: you don’t want to “wash out” or” throw away” good luck. However, before the holiday it’s highly recommended to de-clutter, clean thoroughly and make your home beautiful and festive for the new year. Okay, so that step  
Chinese New Year is a celebration marked by age-old traditions and customs. Similar to many other religious holidays, this auspicious occasion comes with a set of do’s and don’ts, each grounded in cultural beliefs aimed at ensuring a prosperous and harmonious year ahead. Here are some you can take note of this festive season: 
But, living in Hong Kong, there are also certain rules (some not so fun) during the festive season that you need to bear in mind, or else it is said to invite bad luck for the future year. So, here are 10 Chinese New Year traditions, or dos and don’ts, that you should pay attention to! Chinese New Year traditions: Dos and don’ts 1. DO wear  
6. Do stay up as late as you can on New Years Eve. Encouraged amongst children of any age, it is popular in the Chinese culture to stay up as close to or past midnight on the eve of Chinese New Year – and no, the reason is not due to having a public holiday on the following day. 
Taking naps, especially on the first day of the Chinese New Year, represents laziness. In Chinese culture, taking naps on the first day of the new year will affect your luck and career for the rest of the year. 9. Avoid breaking things in your home 
Superstitions surrounding New Year’s Day are as varied as the cultures that uphold them. Many people view the start of the year as a symbolic reset, and acts performed on this day are thought to influence the months ahead. In Chinese culture, showering or bathing on New Year’s Day, particularly during the Lunar New Year, is often avoided. 
Subsequently, question is,why can’t you wash your hair on chinese new year? What the tiger means: It signifies bravery and strength. The holiday comes with superstitions, like don’t wash or cut your hair on the first day of the new year, because it is means you are washing your fortune away, CNN Travel wrote. 
Cleaning immediately after Chinese New Year symbolizes making way for new opportunities and prosperity, and it is important to avoid cleaning on the first day of the New Year to respect tradition. Cleaning rituals and practices, such as sweeping the house from the inside out and washing rituals, are performed to cleanse the home of negative  
The Chinese word for “book” (shū) sounds exactly the same as the word for “lose” – so buying a book right after ringing in the New Year is considered an invitation for bad luck. 
Why You Shouldn't Shower During The Chinese New Year 
Pre-Chinese New Year Preparations and Activities (Jan. 7–Feb. 12, 2025) Jan. 7, 2025: Laba Festival. Some Chinese start to celebrate and prepare for Chinese New Year as early as day 8 of the 12 th month of the lunar calendar. 
Beside above,when should you not cut your hair for chinese new year? It is bad luck to cut anything during the 15 day Chinese New Year period, hence the Chinese tend to go for a haircut before the last day of the Lunar year so that they will not look unkempt, and also because a clean, well maintained appearance matters to usher in a prosperous new year. 
My grandmother passed away in July last year, and my grandfather wants to know what he can and cannot do during Chinese New Year, as well as what prayers he has to do and what to avoid. My grandmother was given a Taoist funeral, so we had a 100 day mourning period for her (which is already over). </p>
