        <h2><strong>chinese new year food calories chinese new year oranges images</strong></h2>
        <p>Ubiquitous in every Chinese household in Singapore during Chinese New Year, rice cakes (nian gao) are a very popular dessert during the festive period. Its sweetness represents a rich and prosperous year ahead, and its round shape symbolises family reunion. Also, the Chinese word for cake (糕) sounds like the word for high (高). 
Nian Gao is a popular staple every Chinese New Year but the calorie count is too high a price to pay. We are definitely gonna cut a smaller slice for ourselves this year. Average: 482 calories per serving 
Before you reach for your 8 th pineapple tart, you might want to consider how many calories it contains. Here’s the calorie count of 10 favourite Chinese New Year snacks, and how much exercise you need to burn them off later. #1 Nian gao – 482kcal per serving. 10,700 steps or 60min of aerobics #2 Bak kwa – 179kcal per piece 
Tang yuan is an Chinese dessert comprising glutinous rice balls (may contain fillings inside) cooked in a sweet syrup. Its round shape and Chinese pronunciation symbolises union, so it is often eaten throughout the Chinese new year period, but especially on the 15th day (commonly known as Dongzhi, or the beginning of Winter Solstice). 
Chinese New Year is just around the corner! Between the thought of the festivities and families coming together again in joyous celebration, everyone is equally excited to be able to enjoy themselves with the plethora of good food that will be served at the dinner table and in the living room after a hearty meal. 
Bak Kwa is also considered a “heaty” food in traditional Chinese medicine, and thought to contribute to the development of coughs, sore throats and ulcers. Serving size: 57g (1 slice) – Fat: 7.8g, Sugar: 24.5g, Calories: 229. We say: One slice can go a long way. One is enough. ***** NIAN GAO 
Pineapple tart – 165 calories for two pieces . They’re available all year round but you’ll still find people selling/stocking up on these every Chinese New Year. The heavenly mix of buttery pastry with a generous portion of pineapple jam, however, can be heavy on the calories scale depending on how much butter and sugar are used. 
Conducted by food and nutrition researchers from the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), the study involving 30 Chinese New Year snacks found that 100g of salted egg fish skin  
No Chinese New Year table is complete without this savoury snack! This barbecued pork jelly seasoned with soy sauce, sugar and honey is oh so good – but oh so bad, too. One slice is 229 calories (the same as a plate of chicken rice or a bowl of noodles) and has a whopping 7.8 grams of fat, and 24.5 grams of sugar. 
For an average woman, the daily calorie food intake should be between 1200 and 1500kcal in order to maintain the current weight. Here is a meal plan that we can follow during the Chinese New Year period, that would make sure you’re eating within the calorie intake limit: Breakfast: 1 mandarin orange or a bowl of fruits; 1 slice of nian gao 
Chinese New Year Healthy Eating. What is Chinese New Year (CNY) without a big feast? In addition, providing food (usually lots of it!) reflects the generosity of a good host. From the succulent meat dishes and seafood at the reunion dinner to bak kwa (barbecued meat), love letters and cookies, the fats and calories soon pile up. 
"Foods high in sugar, calories and fats, such as fried nian gao and bak kwa, should be taken only in small amounts.  Some of my favourite Chinese New Year treats are honey cornflakes, cashew  
Snacking in moderation while being aware of how many calories you’re chowing on will help keep you on track with your goals. Not getting completely derailed will make getting back to a healthy eating plan all the more easier once the Chinese New Year is over. Source: linoralow.com 
I’m thrilled to share not only my cherished Chinese New Year recipes but also a diverse collection from amazing food bloggers worldwide. You’ll find not only authentic traditional Chinese New Year recipes but also modified, popular Chinese dishes across cultures. So, join me in celebrating the spirit of Chinese New Year with these culinary  
Healthy Chinese New Year Food . Know the calorie count of your favourite snacks. One pineapple tart contains about 82 calories, one love letter contains about 56 calories, and a single slice of bak kwa contains a hefty 370 calories. 
Steamer VS instant pot method: As I remembered, my uncles and aunts made sweet nian gao for Chinese New Year. They used their hands to mix the glutinous rice flour and sugar into a paste-like texture and pour them into a container with banana leaves, then steaming them over the stove for 1-1.5 hours depending on how deep the pan you use. 
Cove the lid and continue steam for around 20 to 25 minutes. The blossoming should occur around 10 minutes. So in the first 10 minutes, use high fire and you can choose to slow down your fire slightly or use high fire during the whole process (depending on how much water you added for steaming and do not burn your wok). 
If you can’t give up Chinese New Year goodies, then forgo starchy foods like rice, noodles or bread in your meals. Eat less than five pieces of Chinese New Year goodies per day. Alternatively, opt for goodies with less calories, for example, instead of pineapple tarts and peanut and sesame candies, go for kuih bangkit or kuih bolu. 
The arrival of the Chinese New Year in 2025 will bring about a lively and festive atmosphere, as people around the world ushered in the Year of the Dragon with joyous celebrations. As we exchange well-wishes and red envelopes, the feasting became a central element of the celebrations, fostering a sense of togetherness and prosperity
