        <p>Most of Taiwan is forecast to have cold weather at the beginning of the Lunar New Year holiday next week as a strong cold air mass approaches, the Central Weather Administration (CWA) said yesterday.

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — The Central Weather Administration predicts that a continental cold air mass will arrive in Taiwan on Lunar New Year's Eve, possibly bringing the temperature down to 9 C in north Taiwan. The CWA predicts that from Thursday to Sunday, daytime highs in Taiwan proper will exceed 20 C. On Friday, as the northeast monsoon

TAIPEI (TVBS News) — As Taiwan gears up for the Lunar New Year holiday, which begins on Saturday (Jan. 25), meteorologists predict a significant drop in temperature across the island due to a strengthening northeast monsoon. 
TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — There will be colder and wetter weather in the days leading up to the Lunar New Year, according to the Central Weather Administration ().The CWA said the northeast monsoon will strengthen slightly on Friday and Saturday (Feb. 2-3), bringing brief rain and cooler temperatures to the north, while other areas will have partly cloudy to sunny conditions. 
When is Chinese New Year in Taiwan? Since the Chinese lunar calendar is based on the cycles of the moon, the dates of Lunar New Year vary by year. Chinese New Year occurs on the new moon that appears anytime between January 21 and February 20. The 2025 date for Chinese New Year in Taiwan is Wednesday, January 29. 
The weather in Taipei in February is arguably the worst of the year. It’s cold, it’s often wet, and the sky seems to alway sbe gray. Despite Chinese New Year being called the “Spring Festival”, January and February are the peak months of winter in Taiwan. See here for what I think are the best times of the year to visit Taiwan. 
However, Chinese New Year (Lunar New Year) typically falls in February, and the Lantern Festival on the 15th day of the lunar new year, is one of the most impressive festivals in Taiwan, during which there is an increase in tourist traffic, leading to corresponding increases in travel costs across various aspects. What to Wear/Bring in February 
December is winter in Taiwan, when the average temperature in the northern part of the country is about 15℃/59℉, making it one of the coldest months in Taiwan. Gray winter skies are always so depressing but the New Year's Eve fireworks show would brighten up your mood. 
Traditionally, Chinese have a family dinner at home on New Year’s Eve and visit “temple fairs” on the Lunar New Year to watch performances and buy snacks, toys and other trinkets from booths. 
TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A meteorologist predicted that Wednesday (Feb. 7) will see wet and cold weather for the eve of Lunar New Year. On his Facebook page "Teacher Lin's Weather Station," Lin Te-en (林得恩), head of National Taiwan University's Center for Weather and Climate Disaster Research on Thursday (Feb. 1) wrote: "This year's New Year's Eve will be wet and cold!" 
The Lunar New Year comes in winter (late January to late February) but can make travel a little tough. The Lantern Festival, on the 15th day of the Lunar New Year, is an event to remember. See my guide to surviving Chinese New Year in Taipei and other things to know about Lunar New Year in Taiwan. 
The Spring Festival is a time for family reunions and festivities. Many travelers from across the world also travel to Taiwan to celebrate Chinese New Year. Atmosphere. Taiwan has a very unique atmosphere during the Spring Festival. Since most of the Taiwanese population is Chinese, many of the shops in Taiwan close during the Spring Festival. 
Christmas Day, which is not a holiday in Taiwan, would see temperatures recover to 24 C in the north, and 25 C to 26 C in the rest of the country. Another cold mass was expected to influence the weather from December 26 to December 28, but forecasters predicted New Year’s Eve would be relatively warm. 
"Since Japanese obtained sovereignty over Taiwan, they carried on a number of military campaigns against Taroko people over eighteen-year period from 188 through 1916. Of these campaigns the one begun in May 1914 was the longest, largest and most definitive in wiping out an entire culture..

My brother came to stay with us last Chinese New Year (or Lunar New Year, but most Taiwanese people I’ve met call it Chinese New Year). I was a little apprehensive about finding things to do during the trip as CNY presents a unique challenge for visitors in that the first few days everything tends to be closed, and then the last few days everything tends to be overwhelmingly busy. 
As the Chinese New Year holiday approaches, a 9-day holiday period in Taiwan will begin on the 25th. The Central Weather Bureau warns that from the evening of the 27th (Chinese New Year’s Eve) to the early morning of the 29th (the first day of the Lunar New Year), the cold air mass will bring extremely cold weather to various regions. 
My husband and I have been travelling around Taiwan every year for Chinese New Year (by car), and despite what people are saying, we were never really stuck in traffic jams for too long, never encountered huge crowds or had problems with everything being closed. </p>
