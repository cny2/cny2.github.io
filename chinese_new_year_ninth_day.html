The 9th Day of 2025 Chinese New Year is the birthday of Chinese Jade Emperor. The 8th lunar day is Thursday, February 6, 2025. It is the birthday of the King of the Heaven. 
Chinese New Year, the grandest festival for Chinese people, is celebrated for more than half a month.According to the oldest traditions, people follow a day-by-day schedule of Chinese New Year festivities from the 23rd day of the 12th lunar month, with specific things to do on certain days.

KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 28 — On January 29, people of Chinese ancestry all around the world will usher in the Year of the Snake, the sixth animal in the zodiac, as they celebrate the Chinese New Year, also known as the Lunar New Year or in countries with four seasons, the Spring Festival.

The ninth day of the first lunar calendar is especially significant to the Hokkien people (subgroup of Chinese). Some traditionalists would even venture as far as to say that it is much more important than the Chinese New Year day itself because the entire Hokkien clan was spared from massacre. 
It is said that the ninth day of the Chinese New Year is his birthday – one of the largest celebrations in Heaven to which all of the gods will be invited. Thus  
By this time, it was the ninth day of Chinese New Year – which was also the Jade Emperor’s birthday. The Hokkiens saw this as a sign of divine providence. Since  
On the ninth day of the Chinese New Year it would be the celebration known to the Hokkiens as “Phai Thien Kong” which literally means “praying the Heaven God”. Prayers usually starts from 11pm on the 8th day or midnight onwards on the 9th day. 
The ninth day of Chinese New Year thus, bears equal, if not greater importance, than the first day of Chinese New Year. 
Basically, Hokkien New Year is celebrated on the 9th day of Chinese New Year. (If you remember, I previously mentioned that Chinese New Year is a fifteen day celebration). For us Hokkiens, it is celebrated with more grandeur compared to the 1st day. 
If this day has a good weather, then it symbolize that it will be a fruitful harvest this year. 9: Day 9 of lunar new year is the birthday of the Jade Emperor according to folks' custom, so large scale celebration is being held to thank the gods. On this day, people will pray to "天公" for the new year to be more prosperous and good fortune. 10 
Fourth Day of Chinese New Year 初四. The day to honour the Kitchen god who would return to Heaven to report on the family to the Jade Emperor, some place nian2 gao1 (New Year Sticky Cake) as offerings to appease the Kitchen god who then either can’t speak much due to the stickiness of the sweet cake or speaks sweet nothings about the family. </p>
