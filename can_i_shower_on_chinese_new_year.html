        <p>This year, Chinese New Year begins on Wednesday, January 29. Those who celebrate will be entering the year of the snake. Just like with any holiday, traditions abound for Chinese New Year. Some of Do not shower, sweep or throw out garbage on New Year’s Day: you don’t want to “wash out” or” throw away” good luck. 
Also, the Spring Festival coincides with the water god's birthday. This is a little-known fact about Chinese New Year. Washing clothes on this god's birthday is disrespectful. 🚿 Can You Shower on New Year's Day? Yes, but do not wash your hair. As is typical in Chinese culture, the reason is elegant and logical.

Don’t Wash Your Hair or Clothes on New Year’s Day. Washing is thought to wash away wealth and blessings. Postpone laundry and hair-washing until after the first day. By following these traditions and avoiding the taboos, you can usher in a year full of prosperity, happiness, and good luck. Wishing you a joyous and auspicious Chinese New  
Leave your hair as it is on the first day of the New Year. The Chinese character for hair is the same first character in the word for prosper.  LNY fundamentalists will tell you taking a shower  
The red color is ubiquitous in China for the new year. It is considered auspicious and lucky. You’ll find red lanterns, strings of real (or fake) chili peppers, and red colored greetings fixed to doors and windows. People will be given red envelopes with money. Red clothing is considered good luck for new year’s day and throughout the spring. 
Chinese New Year is the time where family and friends gather to celebrate a year of happiness, prosperity, health, and good fortune. There are plenty of fun things to do during Chinese New Year , including feeding your family with the best CNY menus and showering them with festive gifts . 
Some of those Chinese New Year taboos will only sustain for first few days of the festival, while others may be kept till the Lantern Festival on the 15th day of the 1st lunar month, or even for a whole month. Hereunder are 16 things you should never do during the Chinese New Year. 
There are many Chinese New Year traditions about dos and don'ts. Find out the top 18 things you should not do. Some are taboos on the first day of the Chinese New Year and some are superstitions for the whole New Year Festival season (from the 1st to 15th of the Lunar New Year). 1. Avoid taking medicine. 
Chinese New Year DOs. 1. Do give ang pows to those who are unmarried. While this may seem rather obvious at first glance, handing out ang pow packets to unmarried individuals and children have long been a tradition in Chinese culture, especially during the festive season of Chinese New Year or even during birthdays and weddings. 
9. Do not give New Year blessings to someone still in bed. You are supposed to give New Year blessings (拜年 / bài nián). But let the recipient get up from bed first. Otherwise, they’ll be bed-ridden for the entire year. You also shouldn’t tell someone to wake up. You don’t want them to be rushed around or bossed for the year. 
People usually clean hair before new year and choose to cut their hair on the second day of the second lunar month, known as "Longtaitou" in Chinese culture. 7. Avoid sweeping and taking out of garbage: 
Cheongsams are a popular choice of outfit for festive seasons like Chinese New Year. Can I wear pink on Chinese New Year? The New Year usually begins with the first new moon that occurs between the end of January and early February, and in China it spans the first 15 days of the first month of the lunar calendar — until the full moon arrives. 
In Chinese culture, showering or bathing on New Year’s Day, particularly during the Lunar New Year, is often avoided. The belief is tied to the idea of washing away good luck, a concept deeply rooted in ancient customs. Conversely, in America, traditions are less tied to superstition and more focused on symbolic new beginnings.

It should be full to ensure that you will not encounter any hunger next year. You are not supposed to go to bed early on New Year’s Eve. On the contrary, you should stay up late and alert in order to keep the “Sui” monster away. On the first day of the lunar year: Chinese people consider New Year’s Day a very important day. 
It’s actually a good idea to do so, as it will help you get back to your regular routine more quickly. You can follow your own Chinese New Year decorations timeline and clean at your own pace.
