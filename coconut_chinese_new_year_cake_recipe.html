I also wrote an extensive post last year all about Chinese New Year Traditions with lots of links to books and other resources about the Chinese New Year if you’re interested in learning more. Here are some more recipes to inspire you to cook for Chinese New Years: 
Dissolve the sugar and salt in boiling water. Add the coconut milk and any flavorings you want, and mix until combined. Then add the rice flour and mix well into a paste.

Neutral oil, for the pans 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter 16 ounces glutinous rice flour 1 teaspoon baking soda ½ teaspoon kosher salt 1 ¾ cups sugar 4 large eggs One 6-ounce can of coconut cream 1 ½ cups whole milk or coconut milk ½ teaspoon coconut extract 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 
2.5 cups whole milk (can sub for coconut milk, if desired) 1 16 oz. package of glutinous rice flour 1 cup red bean paste 8 large pitted Chinese dates (rehydrated) Directions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a 13 x 9 baking dish with parchment paper. In a large bowl, mix together all of the ingredients: Whisk eggs to break yolks. 
10 tablespoons boiling water 1 tablespoon beet juice (or pitaya or prickly-pear juice or a concentrated hibiscus tea) for color. Optional toppings 
In a small saucepan, melt 250g cane sugar, 60g brown sugar in pieces in 1½ cup of cold water slowly over medium heat. Pro Tip #1 – To Speed Up the Process: break down the sugar pieces once the water starts to warm.

Every year, Mama Lin makes a nian gao (年糕, neen go in Cantonese) for Lunar New Year. The character “年” means “year” and “糕” roughly translates to “cake.” Put together, 年糕 means new year’s cake. In Chinese culture, you eat dishes that carry auspicious meanings during new year celebrations. 
Method:. Use a saucepan to bring 1 cup of water to boil. Add brown sugar and cook until completely dissolved. Stir in coconut cream and oil. Drain syrup through a fine sieve to make the mixture smoother.

What is Chinese New Year Cake? Chinese New Year Cake, also known as Nian Gao, is always eaten at Chinese New Year. Like many Chinese New Year foods, it's an auspicious Symbol in Chinese culture as the name "年糕" is a homonym for "A Higher Year" (糕/ Cake and 高/ High both read as Gao) i.e. the next year will be better than the previous
