        <p>“Korean Lunar New Year or 설날 (Seollal) is the Korean version of Chinese New Year.

Lunar New Year marks the beginning of a new year on China's traditional lunisolar calendar. It is a time for family gatherings. It is the most important festival in China (where it is known as Chinese New Year or Spring Festival), and it is also widely celebrated in South Korea (where it is known as Seollal), in Vietnam (as Tet), as well as Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, and other countries  
Contrary to what many people may think, Lunar New Year is not exclusively a Chinese holiday. True, it follows the Chinese Lunar calendar, but the holiday is celebrated across the entire continent  
Seollal (Korean: 설날; RR: Seollal; MR: Sŏllal) is a Korean traditional festival and national holiday commemorating the first day of the lunisolar calendar.
