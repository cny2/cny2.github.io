        <p>The culmination of more than a decade of award-winning stamps, this retrospective brings together in a single issue all the stamps from our most recent Lunar New Year series. The exquisite stamps, issued from 2009 to 2020, were part of one of Canada Post’s most popular and longest-running series, which featured such elaborate techniques as  
About the Stamps. Designed by Paprika, this collectible, wrap-up issue features all 24 of the original stamp designs – one Permanent ™ domestic rate stamp and one international stamp rate from each year – from the 2009 to 2020 Lunar New Year series. Sharing standardized elements, such as size, palette, perforations and special effects  
Swirls, a graphic element from ancient Chinese designs, are placed at the bottom of the domestic-rate stamp to represent the water element. The Chinese characters in the top right corner spell out “dragon.” “It’s always a challenge to find novel ways to showcase the Lunar New Year stamps,” says Alain Leduc, Canada Post Stamp Design  
From 2009 to 2020, Canada Post issued an exquisite Chinese New Year stamp that was part of one of Canada Post’s most popular and longest-running series, which featured such elaborate techniques as gold and silver foiling and multi-level embossing. In 2021, Canada Post issued a special tribute to the culmination of more than a decade of award  
The stamps, which mark the second release in a twelve-year Lunar New Year series, were designed by Wilco Design in Toronto. “The Year of the Tiger issue is a cross-cultural celebration of the tiger figure in the Chinese tradition,” says the firm’s principal, Wilson Lam.

Canada Post is celebrating the end of its 12-year Lunar New Year stamp series with a retrospective that “brings together in a single issue all of the stamps” from the series. This retrospective includes 24 stamps to be issued Jan. 15 in a pane of 12 and a booklet pane of 12. 
The issue will be the first release in a new 12-year Lunar New Year series. The international stamp was inspired by long traditions of Chinese art and Lunar New Year decor. “We featured a work of pottery, as the art form is heavily rooted in Chinese history,” explains Ivan Novotny, Vice President of Design at Toronto’s Taylor|Sprules  
These stamps are the fourth release in a twelve-year Lunar New Year series. “Lunar New Year is celebrated around the world, in countries and territories with significant Chinese communities. Canada Post is proud to celebrate the occasion by issuing these popular stamps,” said Jim Phillips, Director of Stamp Services at Canada Post. 
Another pair of Year of the Rat stamps (Scott #2257-28) were issued in 2008 to close out Canada Post’s previous Lunar New Year series. Designed by Toronto-based artist Harvey Chan, they feature two stylized rats based on another Chinese folk tale, “The Mouse Bride.” 
The new stamps mark the end of our second Lunar New Year series, which contained some of the most popular stamps we’ve ever produced. The first series ran from 1997 to 2008. “It’s a perennial favourite with collectors and consumers alike,” says Jim Phillips, Canada Post’s Director of Stamp Services. 
Since then, Canada Post has been issuing a stamp for the Chinese New Year each year. 2009-2021 From 2009 to 2020, Canada Post issued an exquisite Chinese New Year stamp that was part of one of Canada Post’s most popular and longest-running series, which featured such elaborate techniques as gold and silver foiling and multi-level embossing.

Two commemorative stamps issued by Canada Post celebrate the Year of Snake, commencing January 24, 2001 and ending February 11, 2002. Many artists collaborated to create this issue, including designer Marlene Wou, jade sculptor Lyle Sopel, and calligrapher Yukman Lai. Wou chose a jade sculpture as the background because the semi-precious stone has long been valued by the Chinese culture. The  
“A merry wedding procession of rats is a common folk-art motif associated with the Chinese New Year,” explains Ng. “The snowy scene, reminiscent of Canada or northern China, joyfully captures the celebration of the wedding – and the coming new year.” The Year of the Rat begins January 25, 2020, and ends February 11, 2021. 
On the domestic stamp, a red snake slithers on curving waves, symbolizing the water influence on this particular Year of the Snake. On the international stamp, a yellow and green jade snake, artfully embossed on multiple levels to provide three-dimensionality and simulate scales, coils into a stylized 8, the luckiest and most valued number by

This Lunar New Year release honours the dragon - both an ancient symbol of China and an evocative creature of myth. The Year of the Dragon is commemorated with an intricately detailed, domestic-rate pane of 25 stamps, First Day Covers, a souvenir sheet with one international-rate stamp, and an uncut press sheet incorporating 12 souvenir sheets.
