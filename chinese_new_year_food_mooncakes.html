Chinese: 月饼 yuèbǐng /ywair-bing/ 'moon-cake(s)' Mooncakes are Round or Square Stuffed Pastries. Mooncakes typically measure around 5 to 10 cm (2 to 4 inches) across and up to 5 cm (2 inches) deep. Most mooncakes have a pastry skin enveloping a sweet, dense filling. 
(Press each mooncake firmly into the mould to create intricate patterns, and ensure the sides of the mooncake are smooth to prevent cracks during baking). Step 5 – Bake: Bake at 325°F for five minutes, then brush with egg wash and bake for another 15 minutes. 
Instructions For the dough: Mix golden syrup, lye water, and vegetable oil accurately in a mixing bowl. Sieve the flour. Add all at once to the above mixture. 
For Chinese people (and many other East Asian communities), the new year, also known as Lunar New Year has just begun. Starting on February 12, the two-week celebration marks a time for new

Mooncakes are the most iconic food of the Mid-Autumn Festival. Mid-Autumn Festival is the second most important holiday for Chinese people next to Chinese New Year, but it is also celebrated in many countries across Asia. The festival is held on the 15th day of the 8th month of the Chinese lunar calendar and is celebrated with family gatherings  
In Vietnam, Lunar New Year celebrations often contain spring rolls, mooncakes, and banh chung/banh tet—sticky rice cakes filled with pork and mung beans, wrapped in banana leaves, and boiled. 
Chinese mooncakes are usually served as a snack in the afternoon and can be enjoyed with family and friends. Chinese mooncakes are a perfect companion for Chinese tea. Chinese people often pair the pastry with Chinese tea such as pu-erh or oolong. The flavor of tea can bring out the sweetness and fragrance of Chinese mooncakes. 
Repeat making mooncake balls and using the mold until all 10 mooncakes are complete. Once all 10 mooncakes are arranged on a baking sheet, bake them in a 400 degree oven for 10 minutes. Remove and brush the tops with the beaten egg and then return them to the oven to bake for another 8 minutes, or until golden brown.

Mooncakes, usually made of a rich paste filling surrounded by a thin crust, are traditionally eaten during the Mid-Autumn Festival, while sipping tea and gazing upon the roundest, brightest moon  
A mooncake (simplified Chinese: 月饼; traditional Chinese: 月餅) is a Chinese bakery product traditionally eaten during the Mid-Autumn Festival (中秋節). [1] The festival is primarily about the harvest while a legend connects it to moon watching, and mooncakes are regarded as a delicacy. 
In Chinese, "fish" (鱼 Yú /yoo/) sounds like 'surplus'. Fish is a traditional Chinese New Year dish on the Chinese New Year dinner menu. Chinese people always like to have a surplus at the end of the year, because they think if they have managed to save something at the end of the year, then they can make more in the next year. 
It’s true that all Chinese festivals are associated with one or more particular types of food. To welcome the upcoming Mid-Autumn Festival/中秋节 (This year it falls on Tuesday, Sept 17th), I’m sharing a recipe for traditional Cantonese-style mooncakes filled with salted egg yolks and lotus seed paste (蛋黄莲蓉月饼). Jump to: 
Each bite captures the essence of cultural heritage and family ties, making mooncakes a focal point of Chinese New Year celebrations. Whether filled with lotus seed paste or other delicious surprises (like chocolate!) - these round delights reflect the full moon, symbolizing hopes for a year filled with abundance and harmony. 
My family and i eat cantonese-style mooncakes during the lunar new year. It is also eaten during the Mid-Autumn Festival, also known as the moon festival, which has been an annual celebration in China for more than 2,000 years. I decided to try my hand at making my own version of the traditional Chinese mooncake.
