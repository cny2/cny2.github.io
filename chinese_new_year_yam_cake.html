        <h2><strong>chinese new year yam cake traditional chinese new year food taiwan</strong></h2>
        <p>Ingredients: 600 gm taro, diced ; 180 gm rice flour ; 3 cups (750ml) water ; 3 Tbsp vegetable oil; 2 Chinese dried sausages (lap chang 臘腸) 4 to 5 dried shiitake mushrooms 
5. Steam the taro cake. You can use a steamer or set up a steaming station with a large wok and steamer rack. Steam for about 35 minutes. To test the doneness, poke a wooden skewer or chopstick deep into the center of the taro cake. 
Flavours &amp; pairings. A delicious savoury cake, defined by umami rich mushrooms and an extra hit of flavour from serunding udang for an added twist. 
This sweet and sticky rice cake is readily available only once a year during the Chinese New Year season. However, you can also keep, cut and store nian gao in the freezer for up to a year. The lunar new year may be over, but it is never too late to enjoy the yummy and sweet nian gao (glutinous rice cake or chinese new year cake) which is  
Making it from scratch isn’t difficult, but there is a good amount of chopping and prep involved. But many hands make light work indeed, so gather your family members and bond over the making of this delicious Lunar New Year treat. Yam Cake. 140g dried shiitake mushroom oil, for deep frying 490g Thai yam, cubed 75g dried shrimp 
Frying yam cake- Slice taro cake thickly, then lightly pan-fry in a bit of oil for 1-2 minutes on each side to give them a crispy edge. 🥟How to serve Toppings - Add a sprinkle of chopped green onions, chilies, fried shallots, or fried peanuts for a burst of flavor and crunch. 
Method:-1. Combined batter ingredients, mix well and set aside. 2. Heat up oil in a preheated pan, saute dried shrimps (lightly pound) over medium heat until fragrant. 
Heat the oil in wok over medium heat. Add Chinese sausage, pan-fry for 2 minutes. Add the dried shrimp, stir-fry for another minute. Add the scallions and taro, and stir-fry for 3 minutes. 
Like another popular Chinese New Year snack, turnip or radish cake (Law Bak Gou 蘿蔔糕), this is made the similar way with rice flour, Chinese sausage, dried mushrooms, dried shrimps. Yet because taro is far more starchy than a turnip, the wheat starch added in this recipe would make the cake turn out somewhat elastic, balancing the floury  
Cut the cake into 2-inch slices and sprinkle on the toppings. Serve with some chilli sauce or sambal. Alternatively, pan-fry the cake slices before serving to give a crispy outer and a soft inside. 
Nian Gao Recipe Instructions. Prepare two 8-inch round baking pans by brushing the insides with vegetable oil.. Add 2 cups of water and the ginger to a medium-sized pot, bring it a boil, then let it simmer for 10 minutes over low to medium heat with the lid covered. 
Glutinous rice flour (Nuo Mi Fen/糯米粉). The most important ingredient of Nian Gao, it’s made of finely ground glutinous rice (aka sweet white rice). It’s characterised by its sticky, stretchy nature once cooked, thus the name. 
700g yam, shredded finely + 500ml water; 200g rice flour; 75g tapioca starch; 500ml water (200ml from the water used to cook the yam + 300ml water) 3 garlics, diced 
Nian gao (Chinese: 年糕; pinyin: niángāo; Jyutping: nin4 gou1), sometimes translated as year cake [1] [2] or New Year cake [1] [3] [4] or Chinese New Year's cake, is a food prepared from glutinous rice flour and consumed in Chinese cuisine. It is also simply known as "rice cake". [3] 
Line each ramekin with 4 to 6 banana leaf strips. Make sure the strips overlap each other. Turn the strips over the edge of the ramekins. Place a rubberband over the strips around each ramekin to hold them down. 
From classic to creative, these 30+ Chinese New Year sticky rice cake recipes offer a rich variety of options to suit all tastes and preferences. Whether you’re hosting a big family gathering or enjoying a quiet celebration, Nian Gao is a wonderful way to celebrate the festival and bring good fortune into the new year. 
A Popular Asian Street Snack: Steamed Yam Cake. Steamed Yam Cake is a popular snack enjoyed by both Malaysians and Singaporeans alike. Known as Kuih Keladi, this is basically a steamed cake (kueh) that is made from fresh yam, dried shrimps, dried shiitake mushrooms and a flour batter. There are many versions of the traditional steamed yam cake. 
Chinese Steamed Yam Cake (Or Kuih) is one of my favorite savory treats! Made with tender yam pieces, dried shrimps, and rice flour, it boasts a wonderfully soft, chewy texture. A beloved classic in Malaysia and Singapore, this delicacy is perfect as a snack or light meal—especially during tea time or family gatherings. 
Not just any Yam Cake this Lunar New Year but an 8-Treasure Yam Cake for endless abundance 💰 This Yam Cake is not like any other with extra flavourful goodness from Sio Bak, Chinese sausages, dried scallops and shrimps! The mix of seafood umami and earthy undertones from mushrooms and meat makes for a delicious (and prosperous) breakfast. 
This is a Chinese steamed cake that brings fond memories. When I was young, the cake was prepared for offering to the ancestors and the recipe that I am going to share is the type of yam cake that my late mum used to prepare. Usually, the cake was savoury and prepared using yam, however, it can also be prepared using potatoes and/or pumpkins. </p>
