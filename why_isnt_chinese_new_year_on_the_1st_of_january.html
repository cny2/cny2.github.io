        <p>First, locate the date for the Winter Solstice – usually December 21st or 22nd - and count 2 new moons from that date. The second new moon is the first day of Chinese New Year. The fifteenth day after Chinese New Year day is Lantern Festival (the first full moon of the New Year) and marks the official end to the Chinese New Year or Spring  
Ever wondered why Chinese New Year doesn’t fall on New Year’s Day? Turns out, there’s a legit reason behind it. Yes, it’s astronomy. Here’s the thing: The Chinese calendar is a lunar  
In 2014, the Chinese New Year falls on Jan. 31, a full month after the western calendar celebrated New Year's Day on Jan. 1. Not only do the New Year celebrations not match up this year, they  
January 1st hasn’t always been New Year’s Day in the Gregorian calendar. In medieval Europe, March 25 — the Feast of the Annunciation — was considered the start of the year. 
Why the (Chinese) Lunar New Year Isn’t Really a Lunar New Year.  Today, the Japanese New Year falls on the 1st of January, and people celebrate it by splurging on expensive cold meals. 
Chinese New Year is extremely special because it’s all about tradition, celebration, and spending time with those who mean the most to you. One of the biggest questions people seem to have is about why the Chinese New Year date happens to change every 365 days. Here’s what you should know if you’re new to celebrating the holiday. 
This calendar, first adopted by Pope Gregory in the 1500s, sets Jan. 1 as the beginning of the new year and is currently in the year 2024 A.D. A few countries, however, operate on entirely  
As a result, an ordinary year has 12 months while a leap year has 13 months. And an ordinary year has 354, or 355 days, and a leap year has 384 or 385 days. So the first day of the first month in the lunar calendar, Chinese New Year’s Day, varies every year. 
And an ordinary year has 354, or 355 days, and a leap year has 384 or 385 days. So the first day of the first month in the lunar calendar, Chinese New Year’s Day, varies every year. 
In 1912, the government decided to abolish Chinese New Year and the lunar calendar, but adopted the Gregorian calendar instead and made January 1 the official start of the new year. After 1949, Chinese New Year was renamed to the Spring Festival. It was listed as a nationwide public holiday. 
In many countries the New Year begins on January 1. However, this wasn’t always the case. In fact, for centuries, other dates marked the start of the calendar, including March 25 and December 25. So how did January 1 become New Year’s Day? We can partly thank the Roman king Numa Pompilius. 
People didn’t always celebrate the new year on January 1. The earliest recording of a new year celebration is believed to have been in Mesopotamia, circa 2000 B.C. 
Of course, January 1st isn’t the only date that marks the start of the new year. While the Gregorian calendar reigns supreme in much of the world, many cultures still celebrate their own New  
Kung Hei Fat Choi! Happy Chinese New Year! It’s the 1st of January, 4715 in Chinese calendar year. Even though I have put the picture of the two cute cats here, but this year is actually the Year of Rooster. In fact, there is no year of the cat at all in Chinese Zodiac! Quite [] 
During the 1570s, Pope Gregory put the Gregorian calendar into effect, restoring Jan. 1 as the first day of the new year. This change in tradition wasn't officially implemented by England until 1752. 
During the Han Dinasty, the reign of Emperor Wudi decided to celebrate it on the first day of the Lunar New Year, the world-famous Chinese New Year. After the foundation of the Republic of China in 1912, the Solar/Gregorian calendar was adopted and it began to be celebrated on January 1st. 
Caesar’s new calendar had another innovation: a new year beginning on January 1, the day its consuls—a pair of men who constituted the republic's executive branch—took office. But though the  
Chinese new year these days is just a cultural thing, for like actual international diplomacy china uses the same calendar and years and everyone else. So no, they don’t use 2023. It’s like how technically the Christian year started a couple weeks ago with the first Sunday of Advent. 4 weeks before Christmas.
