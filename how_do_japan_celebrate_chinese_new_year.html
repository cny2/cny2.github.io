        <p>The Lunar New Year, also known as Chinese New Year is usually celebrated between late January and February, during the first new moon. This year, it will be on Wednesday, January 2025. But if you’re in Japan, you may be wondering, “Does Japan celebrate Chinese New Year?” Here’s what you should know. Does Japan Celebrate Chinese New Year? 
The short answer is: No. Japanese do not celebrate New Year in the same way as other Asian countries do. From the 6th Century BC, Japan had a calendar that combined lunar and solar calendars. This was used as the main way of keeping time in Japan until 1873. 
Chinese New Year is an annual festival originated in China and Chinese communities around the world celebrate the beginning of a new year based on the traditional Chinese calendar. The Chinese New Year starts on the new moon which appears sometime between January 21 and February 20. In 2024, it’s from February 10 to 17! During the Chinese New  
Modern-day Japan does not celebrate Lunar New Year the same way its neighbors do, but several shōgatsu traditions are similar due to their shared history. Both traditions emphasize cleaning the home before the first day of the new year to sweep away the problems of last year (called ōsōji 大掃除, or “big cleaning”). 
Wondering if Japan joins in on the Chinese New Year festivities? The short answer is no—Japan doesn’t officially celebrate Chinese New Year. Instead, the country follows the Gregorian calendar for its own New Year traditions, called shōgatsu, which kicks off on January 1st. That said, Lunar New Year isn’t entirely absent in Japan! 
Has Japan Ever Celebrated The Lunar New Year? There was a time when Japan did celebrate the Lunar New Year. In the sixth century CE, the Chinese lunisolar calendar became the main way of timekeeping within Japan. This lasted until the year 1873. Before this came about, Japan actually celebrated New Year’s Day along with Vietnam, Korea and China. 
In modern Japan, the Gregorian New Year is celebrated, so the Lunar New Year is not a part of most Japanese people’s lives. Most Japanese people are unaware of the Lunar New Year and only hear about it mostly as Chinese New Year on the TV news. So, many people in Japan really do not know what Chinese New Year is.

For the celebration of the new year, the festivities begin in Kobe in the morning usually with a Chinese acrobatic dance show. Nagasaki Chukagai. This is the oldest Chinatown in Japan. Focused in an area of 200 m², the area was the residence of many sailors and Chinese merchants between the 15th and 19th century who traded with Japan. 
For many who celebrate the Lunar New Year in Japan, this occasion is also marked by simply spending time with friends and loved ones.
