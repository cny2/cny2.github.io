        <p>Nian, The Chinese New Year Dragon Hardcover – Picture Book, December 15, 2019 by Virginia Loh-Hagan (Author), Timothy Banks (Author) 4.8 4.8 out of 5 stars 51 ratings 
The legends of Nian (which means "year" in Chinese) comes from Chinese folklore, although author Virginia Loh-Hagan, who explored the topic of Chinese New Year in her previous picture-book, PoPo's Lucky Chinese New Year, alters it somewhat, in order to make the hero a young girl. The story here is entertaining, and offers an explanation for  
The bright red color used to frighten Nian really pops against the otherwise muted palette.VERDICT A wonderful version of a classic legend and a welcome addition to holiday collections. --School Library Journal Nian: The Chinese New Year Dragon is one of the best children's books that I've read in a long time. The story, about a clever young  
This bilingual book, presented in both English and Mandarin Chinese, delves into the rich traditions of Lunar New Year, featuring red lanterns, paper cuts for window decorations, and firecrackers. It vividly brings the ancient legend of Nian to life and celebrates the Year of the Dragon 2024 with vibrant illustrations and engaging storytelling. 
He tells Mei that it is her destiny to face and defeat Nian. But she must do it within 15 days or the dragon will be free forever. Author Virginia Loh-Hagan (PoPo’s Lucky Chinese New Year) gives this retelling of the Nian legend an original twist, while explaining the origins of Chinese New Year traditions. 
Kirkus reviews - Nian, The Chinese New Year Dragon This retelling of a Chinese legend explains why people light firecrackers, wear red, and give food offerings to celebrate Chinese New Year. In Loh-Hagan’s account, a fierce dragon named Nian ruled the land until a magical warrior’s spell forced him underground. 
Endnotes explain more about Chinese New Year traditions but do not address why the evil monster here is a dragon when dragons in Chinese folklore are traditionally auspicious creatures. A charming retelling of a Chinese legend despite some liberties taken. (Picture book. 4-8) Kirkus Reviews

Organizing Chinese Lunar New Year books into categories. First, a confession: I have often felt overwhelmed by the growing number of options! Over the years, my children and I have read over 50 Chinese New Year books. Like many of you, I wasn’t sure where to start a few years ago. So, I’ve narrowed down this list to the top 20 favorites!

Beautiful and compelling, Nian, The Chinese New Year Dragon is an excellent story to share during Chinese New Year celebrations and all through the year. The book will excite children to learn more about the holiday and offers many opportunities for home or curricular extensions. 
It’s a great Asian book about dragons and Chinese New Year. I also like the illustrations because the colors are very interesting and unique. Except the cow drawing. Nian is perfect for Chinese New Year and for anyone to read. I like how that the story is based off of the Chinese New Year legend. But above all, this book is great!

A young girl learns the customs and traditions of Chinese New Year for the first time. She experiences the preparation and celebration of the festival, from cleaning the house to receiving red envelopes. My First Chinese New Year explores Chinese New Year traditions, family rituals and the joy of new experiences. 
Chinese New Year (Spring Festival) is the oldest traditional festival in China, but a few people concern the origin and story behind the holiday. Many existing customs and activities of the festival actually can be traced back to a popular story of the Monster Nian, which helps to explain why and how the festival is celebrated. </p>
