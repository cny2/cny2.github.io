        <h2><strong>chinese new year rooster or cock when does chinese new year start each year</strong></h2>
        <p>Rooster is the 10th animal in the 12-year cycle of the Chinese zodiac signs, coming after the Monkey and before the Dog. Recent years of the Rooster include 2017, 2005, 1993, 1981, 1969, 1957, and 1945, with the next Rooster year in 2029 (Year of the Earth Rooster). It is associated with the earthly branch sign yǒu. 
Rooster (or Chicken) ranks the tenth among the Chinese zodiac animals. In Chinese culture, Rooster represents fidelity and punctuality, for it wakes people up on time. People born in the year of the Rooster are beautiful, kind-hearted, hard-working, courageous, independent, humorous and honest. They like to keep home neat and organized. 
The year of the Rooster is a time to cockadoodle-doo about your accomplishments. If you’re normally tentative about tooting your own horn, the year of the Rooster will bolster your bravado. Because the Rooster is a prideful side (not in a bad way), it’s good to observe this during the Chinese new year of the Rooster. 
The Rooster ranks the 10th among the animals of the Chinese zodiac. Recent years of the Rooster include 2017, 2005, 1993, 1981, 1969, 1957, 1945The next Rooster year is 2029.

Thus the first symbolic meaning of Chinese zodiac Rooster sign is punctuality. 
The Lunar New Year, or Spring Festival, marks the transition from one animal to the next—2024 is the year of the Dragon, which began on February 10th, 2024, and ends on February 24th, 2024. January 29th, 2025 (Chinese New Year) will signal the start of the year of the Snake. 
A zodiac year starts from 'Start of Spring' according to the traditional Chinese solar calendar, and 'Start of Spring' is on February 3rd in 2029. However, most Chinese tend to name a zodiac year from Chinese New Year according to the traditional Chinese lunar calendar, thus the 2029 lunar year of the Rooster starts on February 13th. 2  
Bidding farewell to the mythical Dragon, the world welcomes the Year of the Snake on January 29 — the first day of the Lunar New Year. For those who celebrate this ancient festival, starting the  
In Chinese astrology, horoscopes and monthly predictions are based on the lunar calendar, running from Chinese New Year's Day to the eve of the next New Year.

This lunar year, which began February 28, 2017, belongs to the Rooster (let’s just stick with that name for now). It’s the 10th animal in the Chinese zodiac, and those born in Rooster years are said to be independent, punctual, and brave. 
Since the ancient times, it has been thought to have the ability of divining the future. Also in Greek mythology, it is said that the rooster can feel what will happen in the future. So, it is regarded as the god's ambassador. The people born in the year of the rooster also have the ability to discern what is coming. 
People born in the year of 1969 (Feb. 17, 1969 - Feb. 05, 1970) are members of the Earth Rooster. For those born before Feb. 17, 1969, they belong to the zodiac animal of Earth Monkey.

So, people with Chinese zodiac Rooster born in 1957 are the Fire Rooster. Chinese people follow lunar calendar since ancient time. Referring to Gregorian calendar, the Fire Rooster year begins from January 31, 1957 to February 17, 1958.
