        <p>With the signing of surrender document, 15 Feb 1942, which was supposedly celebratory being the first day of Chinese New Year, was also the pivotal day that Singapore fell and stepped into a long and dark period of sufferings for three years and eight months under the Japanese Occupation. 
On 14 February, the eve of Chinese New Year, the Japanese again launched a large-scale attack at 0830 hours with heavy support by intense mortar bombardment and artillery gunfire, on the battlefront held by the 1st Malay Brigade.

By evening of 9th Feb 1942, the Jurong Line had collapsed completely due to miscommunication.

15 Feb 1942 marked the The Fall of Singapore. Chinese New Year 74 years ago was sombre and no one was in a celebratory mood. Japan brought World War 2 to Singapore and occupied us for the next three years.
