The Lunar New Year holiday is referred to as Seollal (설날). In 2025, the public holiday runs from 1/28-1/30. Wednesday January 29 is New Year’s Day. Here are our Lunar holiday articles.

History of Korean New Year. Seollal is a cultural holiday, which has its roots in traditional Chinese Confucianism and is celebrated on the first day of the Korean lunar calendar. It usually lasts three days — the day before Korean New Year, Korean New Year itself, and the day after Korean New Year. 
Chinese New Year in 2025 falls on January 29 and ends with the Lantern Festival on Feb. 12. Celebrations last up to 16 days; the Chinese public holiday lasts from Wednesday to Feb. 4. What is the  
Home. Seollal 2025, 2026 and 2027. Seollal, or Korean Lunar New Year, is a major holiday in the lives of South Koreans. Seollal comes in January or February and involves family visits, ancestral rites, eating of traditional foods and playing of Korean games. 
However, the Regulation on Closure Days for Public Offices was introduced to substitute a number of overlapping holidays. Specifically, they are: – Lunar New Year’s Day (if the holiday overlaps with Sunday or other public holidays) – Korean Thanksgiving Day (if the holiday overlaps with Sunday or other public holidays) 
Jan. 27, the day before the Seollal (Lunar New Year) holidays begin, will be a temporary public holiday. The Ministry of Personnel Management on Jan. 14 said the Cabinet approved the designation. Thus the Seollal period will be extended to six days from the weekend of Jan. 25-26 all the way to Jan. 30.

Lunar New Year is the first day of the New Year in the Chinese calendar, which differs from the Gregorian calendar. It is also known as the Spring Festival or Chinese New Year. Every year is represented by a zodiac animal sign. Is Seollal a Public Holiday? 
The government has designated Jan. 27, the day before this year's Lunar New Year holiday, as a temporary public holiday. The government and the conservative People Power Party (PPP) approved the designation during a meeting on Wednesday to "stimulate domestic spending and boost tourism during the Lunar New Year period." 
After the liberation of Korea in 1945 and prior to the Korean War in 1950, the provisional Korean government designated the period from 1 to 3 January of the Gregorian calendar as a public new year holiday. [10] In 1980s South Korea, there was widespread opinion among South Koreans that Seollal should be re 
Korean New Year in South Korea in 2025. The government has designated Jan. 27th 2025, the day before this year's Lunar New Year holiday, as a temporary public holiday. 
Furthermore, the holiday's date changes each year depending on lunar cycles, making it similar to the Chinese New Year rather than the Western 'January 1st' concept of New Year. Festival celebrations in North Korea are often low-key and are usually filled with paying respect to their elders and ancestors. 
The K-pop industry epitomizes trivial controversies, but one issue happens every year—an idol says “Chinese New Year” instead of “Lunar New Year,” and netizens will dogpile until they get a second-rate public apology video. For example, RM from BTS referred to the holiday as “Chinese New Year” during a live stream in 2018.
