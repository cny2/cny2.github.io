        <p>Overwatch Community Highlights - Jeff Kaplan shows us how the new Mei Chinese New Years Rooster Skin looks like after many complaints from Tumblr and Reddit! 
Overwatch just released a slew of fantastic new skins for their Lunar New Year event, but a bug in one outfit has Mei looking noticeably thinner than usual.. The newest Overwatch event is in full  
Why didn’t Mei get a legendary skin for this event, you know, the Lunar New Year, the Chinese New year, the ONLY Chinese Hero? The one person who, understandably, would be the center focus of the event. But Mercy, the Swiss Heroine, the ethnical opposite of this entire event, got a legendary skin. Am I, like, missing something here 
The Lunar New Year event only has one new skin, a $10 Mei epic, which Overwatch 2 players aren't thrilled about. RELATED: Overwatch 2 Players Want A "Classic" Mode Inspired By The First Game What's more, this new skin is essentially a base recolour with a new hat, which isn't too surprising given that it's epic quality, but as it's the only new  
Like most of Overwatch’s Lunar New Year skins, Mei’s outfits for the Year of the Rooster are great. They caused a slight stir earlier today, though, when people who had previously believed  
The studio was hit with complaints that Mei's Winter Holiday skin wasn't that different from her normal costume, but her festive outfit for the Chinese Lunar New Year is definitely a change. Mei  
Compare Mei’s (contentious) Christmas-themed outfit to her new Year of the Rooster skins: In profile, Mei’s tinier waist looked even more unusual, if not straight-up broken. 
Blizzard’s super popular Overwatch is celebrating the Chinese lunar new year by having a Year of the Rooster event, giving characters custom themed skins relevant to the celebration including Sun 
In Overwatch, the Lunar New Year cosmetics were cosmetics that could only be unlocked during the Lunar New Year event, either by logging in, completing limited time challenges, opening Lunar Loot boxes or purchasing them with Credits . In Overwatch 2, you can purchase any of the past event skins that were not part of weekly challenges from either the Hero Gallery with Credits and Coins (750  
Like with Mei, earlier this year who suffered from some aesthetic flaws in her new skin, a major aesthetic detail with the upcoming Blackwatch Genji

People have been illustrating stylized female backs for as long as there's been art, however, there's a key difference to the location of that crucial 45 degree angle. If the "divot" was a little higher, it would look more akin to those image links. 
They could release a skin honoring the year before (I know the season format changes from year to year but if it remained constant). So a skin commemorating the previous year's May Melee. Would be a good way to remember more history in a rapidly changing league, and to hype the tournaments themselves as distinct titles/events. 
The Chinese zodiac, known as Sheng Xiao or Shu Xiang, features 12 animal signs in this order: Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Sheep, Monkey, Rooster, Dog and Pig. 2025 is the Year of the Snake according to Chinese zodiac, starting from the 2025 Chinese New Year on Jan. 29th and lasting to 2026 Lunar New Year's Eve on Feb. 16. 2026  
This is a list of all of Lunar New Year skins, along with any skin-specific voice lines that are attached to them. Unfortunately, there's not a lot of skin-specific voice lines for Lunar New Year skins so hopefully that changes a bit this year! Previous LNY skins.

I’m just upset that the skin doesn’t show off her butt as much as her other skins, it is TF2 with butts after all. 1 Like AngryCats-1999 May 5, 2018, 5:44am 
Overwatch's Year of the Rooster event is live, and along with it, 13 new Chinese New Year-themed skins and a pile of other cosmetics, including profile icons, sprays, victory poses, emotes, and

Yeah, I mean an MMA skin doesn't really fit Mei, but you can tell who watches MMA based on who comments on the braids. It 100% fits an MMA skin, which is pretty shocking because it's crazy accurate to the sport. As an MMA fan, this is so so so cool. Maybe it'd be a bit fitting for another character, but I'm still a big fan of the skin. 
This tho means they'll never be able to tell who else has the capacity to sell well if they keep going to her for most of the new skins. I think a lifeweaver new year skin would have sold great, especially after the way people reacted to the return of the cleric skin plus it would have made a lot more sense for him to have a new year skin over  </p>
