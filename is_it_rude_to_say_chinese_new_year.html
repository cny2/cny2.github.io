        <h2><strong>is it rude to say chinese new year sample essay chinese new year celebration</strong></h2>
        <p>This year, the Chinese New Year 2023, will fall on Sunday, January 22nd, 2023 and end on February 5th, 2023. The Chinese New Year is celebrated for 16 days. Wait, can I still say Chinese New Year, or should I say Lunar New Year, Spring Festival, or something else? With the intention of being inclusive, what should this Holiday be called? 
But the bigger issue is that almost every year, the Chinese New Year coincides with the Korean New Year (Seollal), the Vietnamese New Year (Tết) and the Tibetan New Year (Losar). Not to mention that some form of ‘Chinese’ New Year is celebrated in lots of other countries around the world by the Chinese diaspora (an estimated 50 million  
Is it appropriate to celebrate Chinese New Year? Chinese New Year (Lunar New Year) is a time for families to be together. Chinese New Year’s Eve is the most important time. Wherever they are, people are expected to be home to celebrate the festival with their families. The Chinese New Year’s Eve dinner is called ‘reunion dinner’. 
State-run news agency Xinhua, for instance, hailed the celebration of “Chinese Lunar New Year” in Myanmar, Malaysia and Japan, emphasizing the use of “Chinese red” in decorations. 
In contexts outside of China, referring to Lunar New Year as "Chinese New Year" and vice versa can come off as insensitive and offensive because it ignores other cultures, all of which have their own unique traditions, beliefs, and celebrations. 2. How each Asian country celebrates and names their New Year festival is different.

Although around the world, the term “Lunar New Year” is increasingly used, the term “Chinese New Year” remains popular for people of non-Chinese cultural backgrounds and Chinese living in cities where they are the minority. 
Many Chinese social media users in China saw red when bubble tea brand Chagee used the term "Lunar New Year". Read more at straitstimes.com. 
What got some Chinese especially incensed is that they see Chagee’s use of “Lunar New Year” as a betrayal by a company which, having made its fortunes in China by playing up Chinese cultural elements, chose to downplay the Chinese aspect of New Year as it courts overseas consumers on Instagram, a social media app banned in China. 
Some call this holiday "Lunar New Year", as it reflects the start of an annual cycle determined by the moon's orbit of Earth. Others call this celebration "Chinese New Year" based on an argument that the holiday originated in China under its lunisolar calendar. However, other Asian cultures also celebrate holidays at this time of year. 
Celebrating the Chinese New Year. In Chinese-speaking countries, the Spring Festival (春节 chūn jié) is a general term used to refer to the festival season.This term is likely to replace the English phrase ‘Chinese New Year’ soon, given UNESCO’s recent decision to include chūn jié in its Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

To some it might be like wearing a dirndl dress to a bar mitswa. To most Chinese, these days, it might be a bit weird and maybe even mildly annoying. Most Americans wouldn't even know the difference. But it's not like Chinese New Year (or more appropriately: Lunar New Year) is Chinese property. Anyone can celebrate it any way they want. 
Rant time: I've noticed a lot of people get all edgy this year when others say "Chinese New Year" online. They immediately respond with "It's Lunar New Year," and sometimes go off on a rant about how Chinese don't own the world. 
Lunar New Year is all encompassing, a way to acknowledge other new years, not just the Chinese one. There is also Japanese New Year, Korean New Year, Japanese New Year, Tibetan New Year, and Mongolian New Year, and they are all on the same day as Chinese New Year.

English speakers are lucky to have one New Year greeting, suitable for all and sundry. That's not the case with Chinese New Year wishes in Mandarin. How you greet depends on who you greet, and some greetings could be disrespectful. Note this chart, which shows New Year wishes in Chinese, and who to say them to.

It’s also why whenever a celebrity say Lunar New Year on social media there will be a lot of Chinese nationalists in the comments demanding him to say Chinese New Year. 
To say Happy Chinese New Year in Chinese, Qin Xie also explained: ‘Chinese New Year is also known as chun jie, or spring festival, so you can also wish your friends a happy new year that way. </p>
