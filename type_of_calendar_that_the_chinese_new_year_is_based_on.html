        <h2><strong>type of calendar that the chinese new year is based on chinese new year cruise package</strong></h2>
        <p>Chinese New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, is the most important holiday in the Chinese calendar. It begins on the first day of the first lunar month, usually between January 21 and February 20 in the Gregorian calendar, and lasts for 15 days. The festival marks the beginning of a new year according to the lunar calendar, and each  
In modern China, a person's official age is based on the Gregorian calendar. For traditional use, age is based on the Chinese Sui calendar. A child is considered one year old at birth. After each Chinese New Year, one year is added to their traditional age. Their age therefore is the number of Chinese calendar years in which they have lived. 
The traditional Chinese calendar, which determines the date of the Lunar New Year, is lunisolar, which means it's based on the cycle of the moon as well as on Earth's course around the sun. A month on this Chinese calendar is 28 days long, and a normal year lasts from 353 to 355 days [source: timeanddate.com]. 
Why does Chinese New Year fall on different dates? Rather than following the western Gregorian Calendar with 365-day years, the Chinese New Year follows a lunar calendar based the moon's 12 phases  
Lunar New Year is the beginning of a new year based on lunar calendars or, informally but more widely, lunisolar calendars.Typically, both types of calendar begin with a new moon but, whilst a lunar calendar year has a fixed number (usually twelve) lunar months, lunisolar calendars have a variable number of lunar months, resetting the count periodically to resynchronise with the solar year. 
Chinese New Year is based on the Chinese calendar (traditional Chinese: 農曆; simplified Chinese: 农历; pinyin: nónglì). The Chinese calendar, also called Yin Calendar (traditional Chinese: 公曆; simplified Chinese: 公历; pinyin: gōnglì), is a lunisolar calendar, incorporating elements of a lunar calendar with those of a solar calendar. 
Each of the 12 lunar months in the Chinese calendar begins on the first day of the new moon, as the calendar is based on lunar cycles. In the Chinese calendar, a year is about 11 days shorter than the Gregorian calendar because a lunar month is about 29.5 days long. 
Calculating Chinese New Year. According to Helmer Aslaksen, of the National University of Singapore, there are two rules of thumb used to calculate the new year in the Chinese calendar. The first rule of thumb is that Chinese New Year should be the New Moon closest to the beginning of spring (in the Northern Hemisphere), known as Lìchūn. 
You may have heard of the Chinese New Year being referred to as Lunar New Year. “Lunar” means the start of a new year as marked by the lunar calendar. The Chinese used the lunar calendar for thousands of years until they adopted the Gregorian calendar in the 20th century. Did you know: the Chinese zodiac is based on the lunar calendar. 
For Chinese people, Lunar New Year is the Spring Festival,  Your sign is determined by birth year—using the lunar calendar—so if you were born between February 17, 1988, and February 5

Layue (simplified Chinese: 腊月; traditional Chinese: 臘月; pinyin: Làyuè) is a term often associated with Chinese New Year as it refers to the sacrifices held in honour of the gods in the twelfth lunisolar month, hence the cured meats of Chinese New Year are known as larou (simplified Chinese: 腊肉; traditional Chinese: 臘肉; pinyin  
Also called the Spring Festival (春节 Chūnjié), the Chinese New Year celebrates the beginning of the Chinese year based on the traditional Chinese lunisolar calendar and officially ends 15 days later with the Lantern Festival (元宵节 Yuánxiāo jié).
