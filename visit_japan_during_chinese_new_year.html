        <p>Ultimately, visiting Japan during Chinese New Year can offer a mix of vibrant celebrations and peaceful escapes, depending on your destination. Places to Visit During Lunar New Year in Japan 1. Yokohama Chinatown (Yokohama Chukagai) 
The Lunar New Year, also known as Chinese New Year is usually celebrated between late January and February, during the first new moon. This year, it will be on Wednesday, January 2025. But if you’re in Japan, you may be wondering, “Does Japan celebrate Chinese New Year?” Here’s what you should know. Does Japan Celebrate Chinese New Year? 
Chinese New Year is an annual festival originated in China and Chinese communities around the world celebrate the beginning of a new year based on the traditional Chinese calendar. The Chinese New Year starts on the new moon which appears sometime between January 21 and February 20. In 2024, it’s from February 10 to 17! During the Chinese New  
Domestic and international travel activity is intense during the New Year holidays, as many people visit their families on the countryside or undertake domestic or overseas trips. Travel activity is particularly intense from December 29 to December 31 when many urbanites leave the big cities (especially Tokyo ) and from January 2 to January 4  
The rules were very strict. No Chinese were not allowed to leave the area defined by the city government. Now, however, it is the fastest growing Chinatown in Japan. This area is renowned for its Nagasaki Lantern Festival for the Chinese New Year. Its main street is covered by almost 15,000 lanterns on which animals of the zodiac are represented. 
As with most festivals, there are certain foods to be enjoyed at this time of year, in particular Chinese cakes, but also Japan being Japan, other sweets are enjoyed during Lunar New Year. Japanese patisseries and bakeries will celebrate the New Year with wagashi (traditional Japanese sweets ) fashioned in the shape of the Chinese zodiac animal  
If you want to celebrate the year of the snake in Japan, there are few better places to visit than Yokohama Chinatown, which has observed Chinese Spring Festival traditions since 1986. 
While the Lunar New Year is not a national holiday in Japan — much like Christmas in Japan, you might be surprised to learn! — there are festivals in certain parts of the country. These events are mostly run and attended by those of Chinese descent, but Japanese residents and foreign travelers alike can’t help but get wrapped up in this  
"For the Japanese, New Year is their most important season of the year – sort of like a culmination of Chinese New Year, Hari Raya, Deepavali, and Christmas all rolled into one week of holidays. As such, there are many traditional things to do during this season, whether it’s visiting temples, catching the first sunrise of the year, or attending countdown events. The majority of 
Nagasaki's Chinese New Year festival fills the city with light The Nagasaki Lantern Festival is held over the first 15 days of the Chinese New Year. During this time, Nagasaki comes alive with an energetic burst of lanterns, parades, and performances. 
Answer 1 of 7: Hi all, I'm planning to visit Tokyo with my wife during the Chinese New Year period of 20-24Jan. It'll be our first visit to Tokyo! Is Chinese New Year celebrated in a big way in Japan?

If you’re considering a trip to Japan during one of the country’s peak travel seasons, be aware that things can get crowded. After swaths of springtime sakura bloom across the country, domestic travel spikes during holidays like Golden Week and Obon, while New Year’s travel means wide-ranging closures and high demand for the best hotels and ryokans. 
I was planning on going to DisneySea next year Feb 10 but when I was checking I noticed that it's the same day as Chinese New Year. Should I be worried about big crowds? I've heard I should avoid popular tourist destinations during their holidays though I'm not sure Japanese people celebrate Chinese New Year. 
The best time to visit for the Chinese New Year in Japan and celebrate there is late January or February. During this time, there are family get together and a huge dinner where they eat a special meal full of dishes believed to bring good fortune. 
Be aware that you may find many things closed at that time. Museums, small restaurants and shops may be closed the week of the Chinese New Year holiday. You'll also have to deal with people going back to work when the holiday ends. You don't have to wait for months after Chinese New Year. Even 10 days afterward would probably be okay. 
Hi all. We have the opportunity next year to visit Japan for the first time. I have 8 days available in mid feb, or 10 days off at the start of April. I am more drawn to Feb for the visit because I'm imagining that it will be less crowded, but my husband has pointed out that this time is Chinese New Year and so it might be just as crowded, as well as being a shorter visit. 
It looks like this trend will continue in the new year, with Japan ranked as the favourite holiday spot for Chinese New Year 2023, which will fall on January 22. 
It’s kinda like Christmas week in the US. You can take part in some New Year’s traditions and there are usually still lots of winter illuminations to explore too.
