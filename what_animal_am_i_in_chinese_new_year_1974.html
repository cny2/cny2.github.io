Today is Chinese New Year 2025, heralding in the Year of the Snake – the Wood Snake, to be exact. Lunar New Year isn’t just celebrated in China though, with countries such as Japan, Thailand  
It is based on lunar months, that lasts for 29.5 days, and lunar year lasts for 12 or 13 months. Chinese New Year date is different every year. Sometimes it's 25 january, sometimes 20 february - this is far cry, so people sometimes don't know their real chinese zodiac sign. 
The Lunar New Year, or Spring Festival, marks the transition from one animal to the next—2024 is the year of the Dragon, which began on February 10th, 2024, and ends on February 24th, 2024. January 29th, 2025 (Chinese New Year) will signal the start of the year of the Snake. 
And this year, Lunar New Year begins Jan. 29. Each Lunar New Year is also marked by one of 12 animals—this year being the Year of the Wood Snake, which follows 2024’s Year of the Dragon

According to Chinese astrology, each year is represented by one of the 12 animal signs—Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Pig. 
The Chinese lunar new year is here, and 2025 marks the year of the snake. Over 3,500 years old, the Chinese lunar cycle lasts 12 years and is represented by a different animal each year. 
In Chinese element theory, each zodiac sign is associated with one of the five elements: Gold (Metal), Wood, Water, Fire, or Earth. For example, a Water Tiger comes once in a 60-year cycle. It is theorized that a person's characteristics are decided by their birth year's zodiac animal sign and element.
