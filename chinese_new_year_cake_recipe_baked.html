        <p>This EASY Chinese New Year Cake Recipe, or Baked Nian Gao, is sweet, sticky, and gooey with that mochi-like consistency when piping hot.(It's also delicious pan-fried.) Traditionally, Nian Gao is steamed but that takes forever, and you have to add the right amount of water for the New Year Cake to come out 
Nian Gao Recipe Instructions. Prepare two 8-inch round baking pans by brushing the insides with vegetable oil.. Add 2 cups of water and the ginger to a medium-sized pot, bring it a boil, then let it simmer for 10 minutes over low to medium heat with the lid covered. 
Method:. Preheat oven to 180C/350F. Beat the eggs and mix with sugar very well. Add coconut milk and glutinous flour, and combine until very smooth. 
Celebrate Lunar New Year with nian gao (年糕), a steamed rice cake made of glutinous rice flour and brown sugar. This is based on Mama Lin's recipe. I made a slight modification by adding ground ginger to the batter to give the nian gao more flavor. My favorite way of enjoying this cake is slicing it into thin pieces and pan frying them in oil. 
All these years, I’ve been making steamed nian gao and it’s a must in our house to celebrate Chinese New Year. The Chinese wants to start the year (nian) high (gao) 😉 I decided I need to try the baked version. This baked nian gao, YOU MUST TRY! I mean it! Even if you don’t celebrate Chinese New Year, this naturally gluten-free cake  
In a small saucepan, melt 250g cane sugar, 60g brown sugar in pieces in 1½ cup of cold water slowly over medium heat. Pro Tip #1 – To Speed Up the Process: break down the sugar pieces once the water starts to warm. 
Baked nian gao (烤年糕) is a classic Chinese new year rice cake dessert. It is extremely quick and easy and quickly makes a large batch, so it is a convenient recipe for sharing with others during the lunar new year!. The most important components in this coconut nian gao are glutinous rice flour, coconut milk, and coconut flakes. 
How to Store Chinese New Year Rice Cake After the first day, store the Nian Gao in the refrigerator for up to 5 days or in the freezer for up to 6 months. To freeze, cut it into single servings and wrap the pieces individually in wax or parchment paper. 
Method:. Use a saucepan to bring 1 cup of water to boil. Add brown sugar and cook until completely dissolved. Stir in coconut cream and oil. Drain syrup through a fine sieve to make the mixture smoother. 
Nian Gao and Chinese New Year. Sometimes referred to as "Chinese New Year cake", this is a popular dessert for Lunar New Year celebrations in many Asian countries, bringing good luck for the coming year. Here are some of the ways Nian Gao relates to the Lunar New Year Celebration. The name itself is actually a pun using the Chinese character  
The Lunar New Year is this Friday, January 31, 2014. One of the traditional dishes eaten during the New Year for Chinese people is a New Year Cake. It’s a very simple steamed cake, made with glutinous rice flour for a mochi-like chewy texture and sweetened with brown sugar. 
Then, I found a children's book in the library, a Chinese version of The Gingerbread Man, which included a recipe for a baked Nian Gao with a red bean paste layer sandwiched inside the rice cake. Intrigued by this, I gave it a try and brought it to my young son’s class for a Lunar New Year celebration. 
This recipe, reprinted with permission from "Asian American Village Online," is Westernized in that it is baked and includes cake ingredients like butter and eggs.It's an ideal recipe if you are short on time or don't like standing over the stove, worrying if the steamer will boil dry. 
1. Eight Treasure Rice Pudding. Say hello to babaofan, a sweet and sticky pudding made with glutinous rice and eight various fruit and nut toppings.. A staple in Chinese New Year, it is believed to honor eight warriors who overthrew a ruthless king. 
Preheat the oven to 170°C. Grease and line a 24cm square oven dish with baking parchment. In a large bowl, place the dry ingredients and whisk together to incorporate. 
Instructions: 1. Make red bean paste.Cook red beans (in the Instant Pot or stovetop) until soft and creamy. Transfer to a food processor and pulse until pureed. 
Line each ramekin with 4 to 6 banana leaf strips. Make sure the strips overlap each other. Turn the strips over the edge of the ramekins. Place a rubberband over the strips around each ramekin to hold them down. 
Dissolve the sugar and salt in boiling water. Add the coconut milk and any flavorings you want, and mix until combined. Then add the rice flour and mix well into a paste. 
Glutinous rice flour (Nuo Mi Fen/糯米粉). The most important ingredient of Nian Gao, it’s made of finely ground glutinous rice (aka sweet white rice). It’s characterised by its sticky, stretchy nature once cooked, thus the name. 
During the busy Chinese New Year’s celebration week, we have lots of different cakes (gao 糕). Yes, we can’t celebrate without all the traditional cakes, radish cake, taro cake (aka yum cake), sticky rice cake and water chestnut cake. </p>
