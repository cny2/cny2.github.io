        <p>This year marks the first time a new school holiday is officially observed in New York state. Wednesday, Jan. 29, 2025, is Lunar New Year, also known as Chinese New Year. It’s considered to be  
Wednesday, Jan. 29 may not be a federal holiday, but the day — Asian Lunar New Year — is a New York public school holiday. The one-day observance — which varies each year and typically comes  
New York State is ringing in 2025 with a brand-new school holiday: Lunar New Year. For the first time, public schools across the state will close on Wednesday, January 29, to celebrate. What is Lunar New Year? Lunar New Year, also known as Chinese New Year, marks the beginning of a new year based on the lunar calendar. 
The holiday fell on a weekend in 2024, so schools weren't in session, making 2025 the first year that schools close statewide for the occasion. Zoom in: New York's legislation was passed in the wake of rising anti-Asian hate in the U.S., per members of its state legislature. 
It's the first time New York students will have the day off for the Lunar New Year since a new state law was signed in 2023. In 2024, the holiday fell on a Saturday. 
Students in Rochester — and around New York state — won’t be in class on Jan. 29 in recognition of the latest school holiday. Lunar New Year, also known as Chinese New Year, is celebrated on  
New Year’s Day: 1 January 2025: The start of the calendar year celebrated nationwide. Chinese New Year: 28 January – 3 February 2025: Also known as the Spring Festival, this is the most important holiday in China. Families reunite, and fireworks light up the sky. Schools close for up to three weeks. International Women's Day: 8 March 2025 
Governor Kathy Hochul today signed legislation to declare Asian Lunar New Year a public school holiday across New York State. Legislation (A.7768/S.7573) would ensure schools are not in session on Lunar New Year, underscoring Governor Hochul’s commitment to supporting and protecting New York’s AAPI community. 
This also makes New York the first state to mandate school closures for the occasion. Last year, the state holiday’s inception fell on a Saturday, and students weren’t given an additional day off.
