Since music is so important to Chinese culture, I figured there isn’t a better way to welcome in the New Year than to write about some of the coolest and most interesting Chinese instruments! 
The Chinese New Year is a cultural celebration based on the lunar calendar. Explore the use of music in celebrating the Chinese New Year, including the instruments used and traditional songs. 
In the musical world, China has produced truly unique works thanks to a wide variety of musical instruments that are as beautiful as they are complex. With the Chinese New Year upon us once more, let’s take a look at China’s fantastic musical tradition. Kick off the year of the monkey right by discovering more about these amazing instruments! 
Often heard in the Chinese new year festival is a Chinese violin, erhu (二胡, èrhú) that belongs to the spike fiddle instrument class. Erhu has two strings and a musical bow in the middle. The bow can’t be taken off the instrument unless one of the strings is also taken off. 
The music employs as many as 15 kinds of traditional music instruments such as Dizi 笛子 (Chinese bamboo flute), Gaohu 高胡 (a kind of Chinese bowed string instrument), Erhu 二胡 (Chinese two-stringed fiddle) and Yangqin 扬琴 (Chinese hammered dulcimer). 
Chinese musical instruments are traditionally grouped into eight categories (classified by the material from which the instruments were made) known as bā yīn . [1] The eight categories are silk , bamboo , wood , stone , metal , clay , gourd and skin ; other instruments considered traditional exist that may not fit these groups.

We have been reading some books about the Chinese New Year. Hazel is rather excited. In fact her favorite activity is to pull out musical instruments and practice marching for a parade. The books we have read so far are Dragon Parade by Steven A. Chin and A World of Holidays: Chinese New Year by Catherine Chambers. 
The Chinese music instrument first appeared during the Han dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD) and is said to have come from the nomad Qiang people of Northwest China. Harry Gregson-Williams is the English composer who conducted a 90-piece orchestra for Disney ’ s live-action remake of Mulan .
