Nian Gao Recipe Instructions. Prepare two 8-inch round baking pans by brushing the insides with vegetable oil.. Add 2 cups of water and the ginger to a medium-sized pot, bring it a boil, then let it simmer for 10 minutes over low to medium heat with the lid covered. 
Ingredients (serves 4 to 6) Equipment Method. 1. Heat 2 tablespoons of shallot oil in pan over medium heat. 2. Add carrot cake and fry for 5 minutes over medium-low heat until cubes begin to turn golden at the edges. 
Allergy Friendly Steamed Rice Cake. I am excited to share this particular recipe because nian gao is vegan, gluten-free, and free of the top 9 allergens, whoo-hoo!. And I was thrilled to find out that my mom’s favorite sweet rice flour by Koda Farms. is produced in a rice only facility that is free of the top 8 allergens, gluten free, and GMO free. 
Adding the right amount of liquid and flour would affect the texture of the cake. Carrot cake can be eaten steamed or fried, both just as good. Here’s how you can make your own carrot cake 🙂. To make the black and white carrot cake (Chai Tow Kway), just omit the Chinese sausage, mushrooms, scallop and dried shrimps 😉. Ingredients 
Transfer the cooked mixture into the cake pan and flatten it with a spoon while spreading the corn oil evenly; Place cake pan into a steamer to steam it for 20 minutes on high heat and another 20 minutes on medium heat; Carefully remove the cake pan from the steamer and garnish with green onions; Set the cake out to cool to room temperature 
Carrot Cake (萝卜糕) aka radish cake or chai tow kway is a popular dish eaten during Chinese New Year to symbolize "good fortune (好彩头)". Although there are a few different methods in making this traditional dish but generally shredded white radish is being mixed with the rice flour batter together with ingredients like dried shrimps, mushroom and Chinese sausage. 
The word for CARROT is "hu + lubuo" (胡萝卜). The word "hu /胡" is a generic word meaning foreign, so to a Chinese, a carrot is a "foreign" radish, but whoever was translating this dish way back when, mistranslated it mean "carrot cake". So Singapore is now filled with lots of places selling "carrot cake", confusing many western tourists. 
If you're looking for a delicious and traditional Chinese dish to add to your repertoire, look no further than the Chinese white carrot cake. This savoury dish is often enjoyed for breakfast or as a dim sum item and is especially popular during Chinese New Year celebrations. Understanding the basics of this dish is key 
In a large bowl, combine the rice flour and cornstarch with 1/2 cup of water. For a moister cake, add an additional 1/4 to 1/2 cup water, for up to 1 cup total, depending on how moist/tender you like your lo bak go. 
An unusual cake. The faint liquorice aromas from the star anise and fennel pair well with the nutty, treacly flavour of the wholemeal flour. This all marries well with the Szechuan peppercorns, fennel, cassia, and cloves of the spice blend, making a cake that excites all senses - from sweet to umami. 
Remove and drain the softened radish through a sieve and collect all the radish juice from the softened radish in a bowl. Use a spoon to press as much juice out from the cooked radish. 
Melt the Sugar: In a small pot, combine brown sugar and water. Heat over medium heat, stirring until the sugar fully dissolves. Allow the mixture to cool slightly. Mix the Batter: In a large mixing bowl, add glutinous rice flour.

Drain cooked daikon through a mesh sieve or a colander, pushing out as much liquid as possible, reserving the liquid. Put drained daikon back into the wok, off heat. 
It is also called Chinese carrot cake in Singapore since carrot is also called ‘lo bak’ in Chinese! Therefore, I use both terms in this recipe interchangeably. Step 1- Stir-fry the dry seafood, sausage, and mushrooms. First, let me clarify that this Chinese turnip cake recipe is savory, not a sweet dessert! </p>
