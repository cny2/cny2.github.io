        <p>The Lunar New Year marks the transition from one animal to another. The Year of the Dragon, which began on Feb. 10, 2024, ends on Tuesday. Wednesday begins the Year of the Snake. 
Chinese New Year is upon us, and cities around the world are preparing for all kinds of colourful celebrations. From the bustling streets of Shanghai to the festive atmosphere in New York, each locale adds its unique flair to this beloved holiday. At the heart of these global festivities is the iconic Asian culinary brand Lee Kum Kee. 
Do Chinese Restaurants Close For Chinese New Year? Most Chinese-owned businesses are closed during the Chinese New Year. The Chinese New Year or Lunar New Year is different from the New Year’s celebrations in other parts of the world. It is celebrated at different times each year but normally takes place between January 21st and February 20th. 
Is it the ‘Chinese New Year’ or the ‘Lunar New Year?’ The two terms are often used interchangeably. In China, the entire 15-day celebration period is also referred to as the Spring Festival. 
Among China’s traditional holidays and celebrations, none ranks higher in importance than the Lunar New Year (農曆新年). Also known as the Spring Festival (春節), or simply Chinese New  
On the Chinese New Year, the grandest occasion for family reunion of the year, some personal shops and small restaurants are closed. The civil service departments such as the government offices, embassies and schools are closed on the legal holidays. 
Chinese New Year’s Day: January 29, 2025 The Lantern Festival : February 12, 2025 This public holiday results in seven days off of work for employees (as a public holiday, Chinese people will get January 28 through February 3, 2025 off), though celebrations can last for more than two weeks. 
To this day, the Lunar New Year celebration is centered around removing bad luck and welcoming all that is good and prosperous. Red is considered an auspicious color to ring in the new year. In many Asian cultures, the color symbolizes good fortune and joy.

Chinese restaurants around the world — from San Francisco to Hong Kong — have started embracing the trend and offer their own versions of the prosperity toss during Lunar New Year. 
Chinese New Year 2024 Holiday Dates. In 2025, Chinese New Year Day is on Wednesday, January 29. Everyone will be off work from Saturday January 25 to Sunday, February 2, which is nine days off. This year is a little interesting in that people will have several days off before the actual LNY date. 
Pre-Chinese New Year Preparations and Activities (Jan. 7–Feb. 12, 2025) Jan. 7, 2025: Laba Festival. Some Chinese start to celebrate and prepare for Chinese New Year as early as day 8 of the 12 th month of the lunar calendar. 
Another popular time for Chinese food is during the Lunar New Year, which is a major holiday in China. Many people celebrate the New Year by eating traditional Chinese food, so restaurants can be very busy during this time. Why are there fish tanks in Chinese restaurants? There is a longstanding tradition of keeping fish tanks in Chinese  
Additionally, we will ponder the future of Chinese restaurants and whether the tradition of Monday closures will persist in the ever-evolving culinary landscape. So, why exactly do Chinese restaurants choose to close on Mondays? Let's embark on a journey to uncover the fascinating reasons behind this age-old tradition.

In terms of restaurants in Taipei during Chinese New Year, most really do close for New Year’s Eve and the first 2-3 days of the New Year. If you look hard enough, though, you can still find a few open, including most fast food chains. You may also have better luck trying more international or foreign-run places. 
When do Factories Close for Chinese New Year 2025? The dates for Chinese New Year and other traditional festivals are based on the Chinese lunisolar calendar, and thus they change every year, relative to the Gregorian calendar we use in the West. January 29, 2025 is the first day of the “Year of the Snake.”
