        <p>The Lunar New Year, also known as Chinese New Year is usually celebrated between late January and February, during the first new moon. This year, it will be on Wednesday, January 2025. But if you’re in Japan, you may be wondering, “Does Japan celebrate Chinese New Year?” Here’s what you should know. Does Japan Celebrate Chinese New Year? 
The short answer is: No. Japanese do not celebrate New Year in the same way as other Asian countries do. From the 6th Century BC, Japan had a calendar that combined lunar and solar calendars. This was used as the main way of keeping time in Japan until 1873. 
Modern-day Japan does not celebrate Lunar New Year the same way its neighbors do, but several shōgatsu traditions are similar due to their shared history. Both traditions emphasize cleaning the home before the first day of the new year to sweep away the problems of last year (called ōsōji 大掃除, or “big cleaning”). 
Has Japan Ever Celebrated The Lunar New Year? There was a time when Japan did celebrate the Lunar New Year. In the sixth century CE, the Chinese lunisolar calendar became the main way of timekeeping within Japan. This lasted until the year 1873. Before this came about, Japan actually celebrated New Year’s Day along with Vietnam, Korea and China. 
Japan Used to Celebrate the Lunar New Year (A visit to a local temple on New Year’s Day. Image: taka1022/Shutterstock.) The Chinese lunisolar calendar was introduced to Japan in the sixth century CE, and it was the principal method of timekeeping in Japan until 1873. Prior to that, Japan shared its New Year’s Day with China, Korea, and  
In modern Japan, the Gregorian New Year is celebrated, so the Lunar New Year is not a part of most Japanese people’s lives. Most Japanese people are unaware of the Lunar New Year and only hear about it mostly as Chinese New Year on the TV news. So, many people in Japan really do not know what Chinese New Year is. 
What is Chinese New Year. Chinese New Year is an annual festival originated in China and Chinese communities around the world celebrate the beginning of a new year based on the traditional Chinese calendar. The Chinese New Year starts on the new moon which appears sometime between January 21 and February 20. In 2024, it’s from February 10 to 17! 
As with most festivals, there are certain foods to be enjoyed at this time of year, in particular Chinese cakes, but also Japan being Japan, other sweets are enjoyed during Lunar New Year. Japanese patisseries and bakeries will celebrate the New Year with wagashi (traditional Japanese sweets) fashioned in the shape of the Chinese zodiac animal  
The second New Year is on the first day of the Lunar New Year, in line with the rest of the world. These celebrations are on a smaller scale but also incorporate elements of indigenous and Chinese culture. Lastly, the third and final New Year’s celebration takes place on the 16th day of the Lunar New Year, or Jūrukunichi in Okinawan. 
Lunar new year — also known as Chinese New Year or Chinese Lunar New Year — is not only famous across East Asian countries, but also the world. It’s celebrated around late January to early February, which is the start of the new lunar calendar that bases its months on moon phases, meaning that all the countries which follow the lunar calendar join in with their own cultural version of  
While Lunar New Year might commonly be referred to as the Chinese New Year, this yearly celebration can be seen throughout Asia. These 10 Asian countries each enjoy the Lunar New Year with unique  
The short answer is because the Japanese government does not designate the old lunisolar new year as a public holiday. Officially, China does in fact celebrate New Year's Day (元旦) on the Western (Gregorian) 1 January. 
For many who celebrate the Lunar New Year in Japan, this occasion is also marked by simply spending time with friends and loved ones. Victor Jiacheng Leong, a Chinese Singaporean living in Tokyo, explains “In my sharehouse, we mark the new year by coming together and chatting over a comforting hotpot meal.” 
The short answer is: No. Japanese do not celebrate New Year in the same way as other Asian countries do. From the 6th Century BC, Japan had a calendar that combined lunar and solar calendars. This was used as the main way of keeping time in Japan until 1873. 
Japanese New Year falls on the 1st of January each year, following the Gregorian calendar. Chinese New Year follows the traditional lunar calendar, for instance, the first day of Chinese New Year this year falls on the 12th of February. What Japanese vs Chinese eat during the New Year

I was planning on going to DisneySea next year Feb 10 but when I was checking I noticed that it's the same day as Chinese New Year. Should I be worried about big crowds?
