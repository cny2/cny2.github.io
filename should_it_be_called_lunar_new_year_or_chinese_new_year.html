        <p>Simply put, Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year are not the same. Despite being related, there are a few noteworthy differences between the two. Read on to find out what they are. The Differences between Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year 1. "Chinese New Year" is specific while "Lunar New Year" is more general. 
Also known as Spring Festival or Lunar New Year, at least 385 million Chinese people are expected to leave the major cities to visit their families in rural parts of the country to mark the Year  
What Are the Key Differences Between Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year? Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year are often used interchangeably, but they have distinct differences. Chinese New Year specifically refers to the celebration in China and among Chinese communities worldwide, while Lunar New Year is a broader term that includes various  
Every year, the Lunar New Year marks the transition from one animal to another. The Year of the Dragon, which began on Feb. 10, 2024, ended Tuesday to begin the Year of the Snake. 
Each year in January or February, Chinese communities and countries influenced culturally by China all over the world celebrate the festival that has come to be called the Lunar New Year. Some  
Chinese New Year is actually only one festival under the umbrella term of Lunar New Year, which is a festival that occurs on the first day of a new year in the lunisolar calendar, a calendar that  
The Chinese staff at the UN had reportedly suggested using "Lunar New Year" as a way to include Asian cultures outside of China in their celebrations. It's hard to conclude that UNESCO's inclusion of the Spring Festival in its intangible cultural heritage list means that Lunar New Year should be avoided. Quite the opposite. 
You probably already know about Chinese New Year. Chinese New Year is a lunar new year celebration that’s similar to lunar calendars used by Tibetans, Hindus, certain Buddhist groups, and even one sect of Judaism. Lunar New Year is celebrated when the first new lunar cycle starts with a new moon. (A new moon is the absence of the moon.) 
Most people in the UK recognise New Year's Eve as 31 December, however the Chinese and Lunar New Year varies year on year, yet usually falls around the end of January. 
Chinese New Year and Lunar New Year are rich in cultural meaning and tradition. But it’s not the same. Lunar New Year encompasses celebrations of many cultures, while Chinese New Year focuses on specific Chinese traditions. When learning about these differences we can appreciate the diversity and beauty of each celebration. 
The Lunar New Year, or Spring Festival — often referred to as Chinese New Year — signals the start of a new year and the coming of spring for the lunisolar calendar. With diverse traditions  
The Chinese New Year is also known as the Spring Festival. It is the biggest and most important festival in China and East Asian communities around the world. Now, let us know the do's and don'ts  
3. Start of the New Year. Lunar New Year: The Lunar New Year begins on the first new moon of the lunar calendar, which can fall between January 21 and February 20 on the Gregorian calendar. This  
Calculating Your Lunar New Year Animal. The exact date of the Chinese Lunar New Year changes each year, so those born early in the Gregorian year should check the exact date of Chinese New Year in their birth year. For example, Jan. 30, 1976, was in the Year of the Rabbit, while Jan. 31, 1976, was the Year of the Dragon. 
In terms of history, China created Chinese new year with their 12 zodiac signs and new year calendar and other SE countries adopted these principles throughout the decades of history these countries have with China. So it should be called Chinese new year. 
Pre-Chinese New Year Preparations and Activities (Jan. 7–Feb. 12, 2025) Jan. 7, 2025: Laba Festival. Some Chinese start to celebrate and prepare for Chinese New Year as early as day 8 of the 12 th month of the lunar calendar. 
Rather than following the western Gregorian Calendar with 365-day years, the Chinese New Year follows a lunar calendar based the moon's 12 phases. Each phase cycle spans approximately 29 days with  
This year, the Chinese New Year 2023, will fall on Sunday, January 22nd, 2023 and end on February 5th, 2023. The Chinese New Year is celebrated for 16 days. Wait, can I still say Chinese New Year, or should I say Lunar New Year, Spring Festival, or something else? With the intention of being inclusive, what should this Holiday be called? 
In the Chinese zodiac, 2025 is the Year of the Snake. Different countries across Asia celebrate the new year in many ways and may follow a different zodiac. </p>
