        <h2><strong>chinese new year national holidays what chinese new year was 1952</strong></h2>
        <p>Chinese New Year Holiday and National Day Holiday are the only two week-long holidays in China. During these two weeks, people enjoy themselves in a great variety of ways, contributing to a boost in tourism industry, hence the nickname 'Golden Week'. Hotel rooms, train tickets or air tickets will definitely be in great demand then. 
The Spring Festival will have an eight-day holiday starting from Lunar New Year’s Eve. The National Day holiday will last seven days from October 1. Labor Day will be a five-day holiday. New Year’s Day, Qingming Festival, Dragon Boat Festival, and Mid-Autumn Festival will each have three days off. 
The legal holiday is seven days long, from the Lunar New Year's Eve to the sixth day of the first lunar month. Some companies and public institutions enjoy a longer holiday up to 10 days or more, because in common knowledge among Chinese people, the festival lasts longer, from the Lunar New Year's Eve to the 15th day of the first lunar month (Lantern Festival). 
Good news! China's public holidays will be extended by two days in 2025! According to the new official holiday schedule, the Spring Festival holiday will be extended from the previous three days to four days, including the eve of the Chinese Lunar New Year on Jan 28, while the May Day holiday will be increased from one day to two days, with May 2 newly added.
