Many go to Mass the night before or the morning of the first day to give thanks to God and celebrate the New Year with God’s blessings. In the Catholic context, symbols and themes of the festival, including the animals of the Chinese Zodiac, are often inculturated in homilies and through the giving of blessed symbolic objects after Mass.

You will become a new image according to the image of God, our Creator, so live a renewed life.
