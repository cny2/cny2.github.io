        <p>Lucky food is served during the 16-day festival season, especially on Chinese New Year dinner on New Year's Eve, which is believed to bring good luck for the coming year.

Most Americans consider January 1 the start of the new year, but many Asians and Asian-Americans don’t. Instead, they follow Lunar New Year, also referred to as Chinese New Year in the U.S., which begins on January 29, 2025. (That’s the Year of the Snake in the Chinese zodiac, BTW.)

The Chinese New Year, also known as Lunar New Year, is the most important festival in China: it lasts up to two weeks and is the only time of the year when China shuts down.

Chinese New Year is steeped in traditions and symbolism, with various foods believed to bring good luck and fortune for the year ahead. Fish is a must-have dish, symbolising surplus and abundance. Dumplings (jiaozi) are widely consumed during this time, representing prosperity and wealth due to their resemblance to ancient Chinese money. 
Food is one of the things that the Chinese take the most pride in. And of course, a lot of care and thought is put into the menu for the most important holiday of the year. As with Chinese New Year activities and decorations, the dishes are created to give blessings for the next year.

Food Symbolism ___ Food Symbolism during Chinese New Year Celebrations Chinese like playing with words and symbols.
