Step 1: Add water into the flour to make a dough. Knead the dough and then cover it for later use. Step 2: Prepare the fillings by mixing the ground pork with chopped celery, ginger and green onion and add other seasonings. 
The BIG dinner is usually hosted on Chinese New Year eve, “除夕” ( chúxì). The dinner is called “團圓飯” (Reunion Meal, tuányuánfàn) or “年夜飯” (New Years Eve Dinner, niányèfàn). Families usually spend as long as they can around the dinner table, the feast can be 4 hours long or more! Mom Shopping for ingredients
