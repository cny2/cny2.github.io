        <h2><strong>what is the meaning behind chinese new year name animal from chinese new year</strong></h2>
        <p>Since the mid-1990s people in China have been given seven consecutive days off work during the Chinese New Year. This week of relaxation has been designated Spring Festival, a term that is sometimes used to refer to the Chinese New Year in general. The origins of the Chinese New Year are steeped in legend. One legend is that thousands of years  
To this day, the Lunar New Year celebration is centered around removing bad luck and welcoming all that is good and prosperous. Red is considered an auspicious color to ring in the new year. In many Asian cultures, the color symbolizes good fortune and joy. 
Layue (simplified Chinese: 腊月; traditional Chinese: 臘月; pinyin: Làyuè) is a term often associated with Chinese New Year as it refers to the sacrifices held in honour of the gods in the twelfth lunisolar month, hence the cured meats of Chinese New Year are known as larou (simplified Chinese: 腊肉; traditional Chinese: 臘肉; pinyin  
The origin of the Chinese New Year Festival can be traced back to about 3,500 years ago.

Chinese New Year (Spring Festival) is the oldest traditional festival in China, but a few people concern the origin and story behind the holiday. Many existing customs and activities of the festival actually can be traced back to a popular story of the Monster Nian, which helps to explain why and how the festival is celebrated. 
Each aspect of Chinese New Year holds a special meaning and significance, reflecting the hopes, wishes, and beliefs of the Chinese people. From the food eaten to the decorations displayed, every detail is carefully chosen to bring luck, prosperity, and happiness in the coming year. 
Legend of the Origin of Chinese New Year. Chinese New Year is steeped with stories and myths. One of the most popular legends is about the mythical beast Nian (Year). He ate livestock, crops, and even people on the eve of a new year. To prevent Nian from attacking people and causing destruction, people put food at their doors for Nian. 
The date of Chinese New Year changes each year because it's based on the lunar calendar. While the western Gregorian calendar is based on the Earth’s orbit around the sun, the date of Chinese New Year is determined according to the moon’s orbit around the Earth. Chinese New Year falls on the second new moon after the winter solstice. 
‘Gong Xi Fa Cai’: The story behind a greeting . While all cultures celebrate the new year, the Chinese are probably one of the few that use these money-related words as their greetings in the biggest festival of the year.

Why Must Red Envelopes Be Red? Red is a color cherished during Chinese New Year, symbolizing celebration, prosperity, and happiness. 
Preparing for the Lunar New Year. The phrase Guo Nian, meaning “celebrating the new year” in Chinese, evokes warm feelings of family reunions. In China, the Lunar New Year is marked by Chun Yun, the world’s largest human migration, as millions travel to reunite with their families weeks in advance. 
Soon after that, the paper lanterns are incorporated into Buddhism religious practices. It is said that emperor Ming of Han ( ChinaKnowledge.de – An Encyclopaedia on Chinese History)—also known as Liu Zhuang (劉莊) or Han Mingdi Liu Zhuang 漢帝劉莊 (58-75CE) —, saw how Buddhist monks lit the paper lanterns in the temples on the fifteenth day after the new year. 
Legend and Folklore Behind The Chinese New Year. Just like the other Chinese festivals, there are many different legends and traditions behind the Chinese New Year festival. However, one of the most popular and widely known folklore for the Spring Festival is one about the mystical monster named Nian.
